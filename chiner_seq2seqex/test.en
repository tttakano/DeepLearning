during the orientation period when freshmen enter the university , each group sets up a booth within the campus to fiercely compete for new students .
even free papers are issued because there are too many groups .
because there are many different groups of the same sport , some of them form leagues such as doshisha tennis league ( dtl ) , d-league in soccer , and so on .
** groups approved by student support services center
by filling out the registration form and submit it to student support services , they are approved as a registered group

doshisha eve has a long history and has been held about 00 times .
the official name of the festival is " the xxth doshisha eve " where " xx " is not the number of times of the festival but the number of years since the establishment of the doshisha .
this is not a university-led festival , but every year an executive committee of doshisha eve is organized and operates the festival .
although doshisha eve is generally called ' eve festival , ' doshisha eve is an opportunity for ' expressing students ' activities . '
because the purpose of the school festival is different from that of other universities , it is incorrect to call it ' eve festival . '
the whole university is closed on the following foundation day .
the gay bar ' which is held by taisei dorm every year or the costume live which is held by light music club called shibusashirazu at the final day are popular .

this name ' adam ' was named from a children ' s story ' adam and eve , ' but the executive committee of eve complained that the origin of doshisha eve ' might be misunderstood .
while the university sponsors the event , the planning and operation is carried out by the executive committee of students .
and kyotanabe city is the cosponsor supporting public information etc .
approximately 00 , 000 visitors .

after about half a year , the building was completed on the land which had already been purchased , the present imadegawa , so the school was relocated .
at the time , there were two buildings ( the first dormitory , the second dormitory ) and these were used as classrooms on the first floor and as a dormitory on second floor .
although the doshisha was established based on christian doctrine , christians were being eliminated in kyoto at the time , so there were continuous campaigns against the doshisha by local residents .
which is why the university made a contract with kyoto prefecture not to teach the bible during classes on the imadegawa campus .
joseph hardy neesima ( jo niijima ) purchased a former tofu store which was near the current amherst house under niijima ' s name , and taught the bible there which was outside school grounds .

philosophy of autonomy ' is the idea that students who live in the dormitory manage and run the place even though the land and building belong to the university .
in fact , the relationship with the university in the management of dormitory keeps certain tension , and they take the spirit of autonomy seriously while negotiating .
** the dormitory is based on ' philosophy of autonomy , ' so it is called an ' autonomous dormitory ' in doshisha university .
the idea of an ' autonomous dormitory came from a student movement .
around the period when the student movement in the showa period flourished , there was a tendency toward sovereign independence among the japanese universities , and at the doshisha university dormitory such an ideology was born , thus creating the trend which took the idea of gaining autonomy seriously .
the relationship between the dormitory and doshisha university has been positive since the 0000s .
in the past , the dormitory produced persons who became a trustee of the educational foundation of doshisha , and in 0000 , a ceremony and other events were held inviting trustees .

** ashikaga school
** history
** controversy
** designation as historical site
** location
** ashikaga school is a high educational institution of the medieval period which some say was established in the early heian period or the kamakura period .
it was the highest de facto educational institution in the kanto region from the muromachi period through the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
** the school was located in gokagoson , ashikaga no sho estate , shimotsuke province ( present-day ashikaga city , tochigi prefecture ) .
by the early meiji period only its building was left , and the school was finally closed in 0000 .
after closure , only the confucian shrine and a few other buildings were left .
in 0000 , hojo ( an abbot ' s chamber ) and a garden were revived and opened to the public .
ashikaga city board of education manages it today as a site for lifelong education .
** several theories and opinions have been long divided over when ashikaga school was founded . ( refer to the paragraphs below outlining this controversy . )
** his contribution succeeded and attracted students from all over the country from ou region in the north to ryukyu in the south .
the post of shoshu was handed down from generation to generation no matter which region they came from .
** confucianism was mainly taught but its education was also famous for teaching the art of divination .
it also taught the art of warfare and medical science .
during the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , graduates from ashikaga school , who mastered practical studies such as the art of divination , are said to have often served busho ( japanese military commander ) .
the tuition was free then students became priests on entering school .
students lodged at nearby private houses because the school had no dormitory .
they cultivated vegetables in a vegetable garden within school grounds to support themselves .
besides the vegetable garden , they also had a medicinal herb garden .
** according to francis xavier , ashikaga school academy was the largest of 00 universities and academies in japan .
a temple building , whose hondo ( main hall ) had a statue of senju kannon ( thousand armed avalokiteshwara ) , was used for school .
the school was said to have had a confucian shrine in addition to hondo .
** as a result of the siege of odawara by hideyoshi toyotomi in 0000 , however , the gohojo clan and the ashikaga-nagao clan were overthrown and the ashikaga school lost its patrons .
in this period , it faced difficulties because it was deprived of some of its lands and had some of its collection of books carried away to kyoto by hidetsugu toyotomi . , who loved old books .
the ninth shoshu , genkitsu sanyo , who had served as a close attendant of the new lord of kanto region ieyasu tokugawa , gained his trust .
he thereby again revived the ashikaga school with the support of ieyasu tokugawa
** the school was supported by the lords of ashikaga , who were often switched as a result of personnel transfer , and enjoyed its second prosperity as gogaku ( schools of province ) during the early to middle of the edo period .
** later in the edo period , however , neo-confucianism was introduced from kyoto to the kanto region and became the subject advocated by the tokugawa shogunate , which made obsolete the learning of ashikaga school that centered on the art of divination .
in addition , practical studies such as the art of divination and military science became less popular in the era when peaceful time had been lasting , and thus ashikaga school began to wane .
its role as the academic center soon came to an end ; scholars during the edo period saw ashikaga school as a library that stored precious ancient books .
** after meiji restoration , the ashikaga domain attempted to restore ahikaga school by making it a hanko ( a domain school ) .
however , with the implementation of haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) in 0000 , ashikaga prefecture ( later integrated into tochigi prefecture ) took over the responsibility of managing the school and abolished it in 0000 .
** after the abolition , buildings were removed in the eastern half of the its site , where hojo was located , to build an elementary school .
the collection of books of ashikaga school faced a risk of being dispersed because the government of tochigi prefecture tried to buy a part of the collection .
however , a former statesman of the ashikaga clan , soun tazaki took an active role in returning the book collection to the locals from the prefecture along with the western half of the former ashikaga school precinct including the confucian shrine .
** the local government of ashikaga-cho established the first public library , ashikaga school historical archives , in the precinct of ashikaga school in 0000 to preserve the collection of the school and collect commonly available books for making them open to the public . .
in 0000 , the estate , confucian shrine , gates , and other existing buildings of ashikaga school were designated as a national historic site for preservation .
** in the 0000 ' s , the preservation and maintenance project of the historic site started by relocating the elementary school and transferring general books of ashikaga school historical archives to the general library , tochigi prefectural ashikaga library .
in 0000 , the building and garden were restored , and presented in mostly their original form from its most prominent era in the middle of the edo period .
** there have been controversy over how the ashikaga school was founded and how the system had its beginning , because no records were left .
** a theory that supports the longest history of the ashikaga school says it was the provincial schools of shimotsuke province according to folk tradition .
in contrast to this , some argued that the kokufu was too far from the provincial school of shimotsuke province and there is no record describing the relocation .
few advocate the kawakami theory .
a theory advocating that the school originates from a provincial school says it was relocated to the present -day shohei-cho , ashikaga city in 0000 according to " kamakura ozoshi ( military chronicle written during the muromachi period in mid 00th century ) . "
** however maezawa did not give any reasons as to why the provincial school of ashikaga was not abolished and remained when kokufu and the provincial school were relocated to the tsuga district ( toward present-day tochigi city ) .
in addition , there is no convincing evidence such as literature , which backs the theory that the kokufu may have been located in ashikaga .
it should be noted that the location of the kokufu is only a hypothesis .
** a book titled " no no kokugaku " having a stamp by the ashikaga school has been cited as the basis for the theory that ashikaga school originated from a provincial school .
some have suggested that the stamp was a forgery made in later years because such stamps were put only on books written in the edo period and the stamp itself was lost .
however some argued back in the meiji period that the stamp had been faked and that folklore supporting the validity of the stamp had been created .
** another theory regarded as very likely on the basis of kamakura ozoshi ( military chronicle written during the muromachi period ) is that ono no takamura founded the school around 000 ( or 000 ) in the heian period
however some suggest this theory is not credible because takamura did not take a post in relation with shimotsuke province and was exiled in the year when the school is claimed to have been built .
** another theory is that yoshikane ashikaga founded it in the late 00th century .
however , banna-ji temple had no record of it although it remains today .
in addition , some advocates of both theories which say that the school originated from the provincial school and that ono no takamura founded it , regard yoshikane ashikaga as the person responsible for reviving the school .
** an extreme argument goes that the ashikaga school was founded by norizane uesugi , and it did not exist before 0000 .
this is based on " dainihonshi " , history of great japan compiled by the mito domain .
it should be noted that " dainihonshi , " history of great japan , when read in detail , states that ashikaga school had existed before uesugi ' s time .
** on march 0 , 0000 , " ashikaga school ( the site of ashikaga school , including the shrine and the other related buildings ) " was designated as a national historical site .
** daimon-dori street , shohei-cho , ashikaga city , tochigi prefecture
** kyoto jinbun gakuen ( kyoto humanism school )
** kyoto jinbun gakuen ( kyoto humanism school ) founded in 0000 immediately after the end of world war ii in kyoto through private educational movements .
** kyoto jinbun gakuen ( kyoto humanism school ) is the result of private educational movements which occurred all over the country during a transitional period until the establishment of the country ' s new educational system .
the school was intended to reeducate young men and women who had been mobilized as soldiers , factory workers , and farmers during the war and deprived of educational opportunities
** the school opened at the buddhist center next to the kyoto imperial palace as its provisional schoolhouse in 0000 .
** kyoto jinbun gakuen was a three-year vocational school , whose education mainly consisted of general education and professional education ( liberal arts ) .
its educational policy was revolutionary ; it encouraged self-education , recognized thorough student autonomy , adopted coeducation system , and had no examinations ( instead paper work ) , no school regulations , and no penalties .
** applicants started to decrease in the second year after its foundation , straining the school budget .
the school once managed to avoid dissolution with donations by benefactors but were forced to disband in 0000 .
it started an evening school course for working students at its facility in 0000 , which took over its educational policy .
eight years later , the school survived with the foundation of the kyoto kinrosha gakuen ( labor gakuen ) .
also a preparatory school kamogawa gakuen , which was founded in 0000 as a means to cover the deficit of kyoto kinrosha gakuen , thrived as kansai bunri gakuen .
** higashiyama joshi gigei gakko
** located at miyagawa-cho , higashiyama ward , kyoto city , higashiyama joshi gigei gakko ( higashiyama girls school of performance arts ) is an educational organization for maiko ( apprentice geisha ) and geisha girls .
** it was founded in 0000 .
it was licensed as an educational corporation in 0000 under the name of the higashiyama joshi gakuen
five years are required for completing a course of study .
( maiko and geisha can continue registration over five years . )

** turning from a field practice forest to a research forest ( the fourth period )
** problems in the past and today
** problems concerning facilities and management
** overuse and problems concerning animal grazing habits
** following this , the agriculture department was established , and the forest was used for academic research and field work by researchers and students .
in addition , the income from selling wood obtained from cutting down trees in the forest , and from charcoal-making business was used to create income for the university .
it is one of the few large scale natural forests still remaining in the kinki region .
because it includes some virgin forests in , it is sometimes called the ashiu virgin forest or the ashiu woods .
also , even today , the old name of ashiu forest for field practice is still commonly used .
** in the following descriptions , " research forest " is basically used to refer to this particular forest , but " field practice forest " is also used when referring to historical descriptions .
** this research forest is located around the headwaters of the yura-gawa river in the north-east part of kyoto prefecture , that is approx . 00 km north-north east from the central part of kyoto city and borders fukui and shiga prefectures .
its southern and southeastern areas border the hirogawara ( in kyoto city ) area and kuta area in sakyo ward of kyoto city , the northeastern area borders kutsuki-mura , takashima city , shiga prefecture , and the northern area borders the former natasho-mura in oi-cho , fukui prefecture .
** topographically , the altitude is high since the research forest is located in the east-end area of the tanba highland .
the altitude is lower in the west , for example , 000 m at research forest administration building , with the lowest altitude being 000 m .
the initial portion of the yura-gawa river flows in the shape of a u within the forest , and little or big streams along the valleys flow into the headwaters of the yura-gawa river .
as a whole , the land is shaped by its cycle of erosion , as seen in various areas in the tanba highland ; however , the inclination of the slopes are rather steep at 00 to 00 degrees .
the geographical feature is formed from sedimentary rock on the chert layer that extends in the east-west direction on the base rock of the sand stone and mudstone ( shale ) belonging to the mesozoic/paleozoic layer called the tanba belt .
precipitous cliffs or falls are formed in areas where chert dominates .
most of the soil is brown forest soil , but podzol is also found locally in ridges higher than an altitude of 000 m .
** this research forest belongs entirely to the transitional area between the climate on the japan sea side and that of the pacific coast side , with lots of rain falls throughout the year .
the place is also known for heavy snowfall , with approximately 0 meter of snow accumulating in the administration building area and more than 0 meters around chojidani .
although it changes depending on the climate for the year , the first snow of the season generally falls in november and can continue to fall until as late as april .
the snowfall from december and later mostly remains without melting , and many areas of the forest , including chojidani , remain covered in snow from december to early april .
** within this research forest , 000 species of trees , 000 species of grass , and 00 species of fern-related plants have been found .
plants , such as daphniphyllim macropodum var . humile , aucuba japonica var . borealis , ilex leucoclada , and cephalotaxus harringtonia var . nana , which are specific to heavy snow areas grow here naturally .
in addition , hemerocallis middendorffii var . esculenta and caltha palustris var . nipponica , all of which are species remaining from the ice age , also grow here .
furthermore , due to the heavy rainfall throughout the year , a variety of mushrooms , including nameko mushroom , oyster mushroom and lampteromyces japonicus , grow here .
** in the natural forest , plants in warm-temperate forests , such as konara oak , quercus salicina and ilexpedunnculosa , are found in areas lower than 000 m above sea level .
in areas higher than this , plants in cool-temperate forests , including beech and mongolian oak , are found .
however , the boundary between these areas is unclear .
** this research forest has been used for a long time , as described later .
in addition to cutting down trees for wood , around nodabata , clearings were burnt off to be used as hayfields .
after the field practice forest was established , trees were cut down mainly around the headwaters of the yura-gawa river , where a forest tramline was opened before the war , then japanese cedar trees were planted at the site afterwards .
after the war , trees were cut down on a large scale as forest roads were laid out , which reached its peak around the latter half of 0000s to the middle of 0000s .
after that , the amount of tree cutting diminished , and almost no trees have been cut since the 0000s .
japanese cherry birch , hornbeam and spice bush grow mostly in the secondary forests .
** the fauna in this research forest is as diverse as the flora .
in particular , mammals living there also include such precious species as black whiskered bats and japanese mountain moles .
regarding birds , there are screech owls , crested kingfisher and mandarin ducks , and raptors are also found such as goshawks and sparrow hawks .
golden eagles are also seen there rarely
for reptiles , one can find japanese copperheads , japanese grass snakes , japanese rat snakes , japanese striped rat snakes , japanese grass lizard , japanese pond turtle , burrowing rat snakes , and oriental odd-tooth snakes .
for amphibians , as well as the japanese giant salamanders , which are a protected species , one can find japanese clawed salamanders , hida salamander , forest green tree frogs and japanese singing frogs .
for insects , in addition to the japanese rhinoceros beetles , stag beetles , and alpine black swallowtail , a variety of insects , from large ones to small ones , popular to precious ones , live here .
there are some species that were newly found in ashiu .
** when establishing this forest for research , the university paid attention to the following three points :
** the place is located at the center of the japanese cedar-growing area .
** the place constitutes a large botanical garden where plants favoring cold climate and those favoring warm climate naturally grow together .
** its geographical shape provides the possibility that large-scale experiments can be conducted over river basin .
** it can be said that the famous quote " the persons studying flora should once visit the ashiu forest for field practice of kyoto university , " was based on the diversity of its flora .
however , as described later , although the forest was a research facility for the university , it was expected to derive a certain amount of profit as an income resource .
therefore , in the process of pursuing the contradictory themes that research had to be done and profits had to be gained as well , compromises had sometimes to be made both in the research and in the business .
** for educational purposes , this research forest is used for field work and educational programs in each faculty or graduate courses for kyoto university in addition to faculty of agriculture and graduate school of agriculture .
furthermore , the forest is also used for field work or social education by other universities , such as kyoto university of art and design and doshisha university .
** as described later , there is a forest tramline in this research forest .
the only other forest tramline laid out in a research forest ( forest for field practice ) for a university in japan is the forest-for-field-practice tranmline for tokyo university that is laid out in tokyo university ' s chichibu field practice forest , located in the oku-chichibu mountain area .
** before the field practice forest was established , there were no roads that could be called roads in the area .
therefore , immediately after the field practice forest was established , work was started to provide forest roads .
major forest roads were provided so that cars could run on them .
the excavation work to lay out the tramline form the administration building to oyomogi was completed in 0000 , and to nanase in the following year 0000 .
only the roadbeds were completed initially .
however , the work to lay out tramlines was also conducted , and the rails between the administration building and akazaki were laid out in 0000 and extended up to oyomogi in 0000 .
the track gauge of the tramlines was 000 mm , the weight of a rail was 0 kg or 0 kg , cut chestnut trees or cut beech trees were used as railroad ties , which had creosote oil pasted on to protect against rot .
however , even the work to provide rail beds was not conducted for the initially-planned section between nanase and nakayama , with only walking roads provided there .
after the pacific war started , the tramline was planned to be extended up to onokodani to secure the forest resource .
the construction of a bridge to cross the yura-gawa river was completed in 0000 , and the tramline was extended in 0000 up to a work site located in onokodani .
while the main section up to nanase was called the honkoku ( literally , real valley ) tramline , the new section was named the onoko provisional tramline .
in 0000 , a section was extended from the middle of onoko provisional tramline to rise along onoko nishidani ( onoko west ravine ) .
it is said that a looped section was provided on the onoko provisional tramline .
** in addition , the tramlines were also used to convey everyday commodities , such as rice , miso ( soybean paste ) and soy sauce , to the residents in haino .
beech wood was mainly carried out using the onoko provisional tramline , for use in making the blades of propellers .
** in 0000 after the war , the onoko nishi ( west ) tramline was removed , and the rails were returned to their original straight form and given back to the yuragawa-river dam construction office of ministry of interior .
the forest tramlines were heavily damaged by typhoon hester that hit the area in july 0000 .
in particular , entire sections of the onoko provisional tramline were buried or washed out , never to be restored again .
on the other hand , regarding the honkoku tramline , the bridge over the yura-gawa river that had been washed out was restored , and furthermore , the tramline was extended up to nodatani in 0000 .
the tramline remained unfinished for a little distance up to nanase where roadbeds had been completed , but the tramline has never been extended up to nanase .
** after the 0000s when logging was carried out on a large scale , sidings were laid out in akazaki-nishidani ( akazaki west ravine ) up to akazaki-higashidani ( akazaki east ravine ) and were used for carrying out the lumber .
however , after the logging business was terminated in mid-0000s , the value of the usage of the forest tramlines diminished .
since then , they were used only to commute to the fields for seedlings and work sites provided along the line and for carrying in materials and seedlings .
then , when that was finished around 0000 , the use of the tramlines was even further diminished .
after the 0000s , the facility became increasingly degraded , and no operation beyond haino came to be conducted .
on the other hand , no road was provided for the remaining section up to haino , and the tramline had to be used thereafter .
therefore , the yura-gawa river bridge that had been destroyed many times was replaced with a reinforced concrete one in 0000 and the tramroads were improved , for example , by replacing some of the tramroad ties with those of concrete .
the improved sections were extended to more and more remote areas .
in 0000 , the haino-bashi bridge was replaced with a steel girder and therefore , the sections whose facilities were to be improved were extended over haino .
recently , hand rails have been provided for the yura-gawa river bridge to prevent pedestrians from falling .
** concerning the tramcars , the tokyo university tramline for the field practice forest owned full-fledged gasoline locomotives and diesel locomotives because the university conducted logging business on a large scale .
in this research forest , man-power or horse-power was used initially to push tramcars , and on down-slopes , they slid by themselves , controlled by a brake .
after that , locomotives were introduced to increase the efficiency of work .
however , they were simply made , with an engine for agricultural use , set on the bed of a tramcar and a simple roof placed over it , and were called stall-type locomotives .
in addition to locomotives , self-propelled vehicles for people , using an engine of the daihatsu midget , were also provided and used to make inspection tours within the forest .
when the logging business was conducted on a large scale , the business operators brought in their own locomotives and/or tramcars , but the details are not known .
** the present forest tramline is still in operation although infrequently , and used to carry out inspection tours in areas up to haino as well as other work .
in the remote areas beyond haino , there are fallen stones , fallen trees , or rotten and collapsed tree bridges like the big ω loop bridge at akazaki one after another , and it is difficult to walk there , to say nothing of restoring the tramroard .
** however , the area where this forest for research located was in the most remote part of the headwaters area of the yura-gawa river .
as well as this mass-consumption , there was also a demand for wood to be used in constructing buildings castle-centered towns such as fukuchiyama city and ayabe city which were located along the yura-gawa river and obama city on the other side of the mountain .
furthermore , there were also local demands for wood for construction , materials for woodworks or for making charcoals .
in such situations , mountain guardians who moved from nine small communities in the valleys around the headwaters of the yura-gawa river which formed chii-mura village later , came to live in the mountain to engage in logging or making charcoal ,
in addition , kijishi ( wood masters ) who moved within the mountains seeking wood also came to live there , making wooden craft works , such as wooden bowls and trays .
therefore , this road acted as a sub-route connecting kyoto and obama .
where kamidani ( upper valley ) and shimodani ( lower valley ) meet
this community had almost no connection with chii downstream but had connections with harihata-go community and chimi-mura village , wakasa province .
at the site of the old residences in nodabata , the pine trees and japanese plum tress that the residents there planted still remain even today .
** nakayama-sha shrine located around the boundary between the two mountains was called " utsu shi shrine , " and the area around the shrine was called " chimata-yama ( everybody ' s mountain ) " and was a mountain shared by people in both villages .
thus , there were many people that had settled and lived in this area since long ago .
however , in the latter half of the edo period , most of the mountain guardians who had lived there left , then only a few remained in haino located at the entrance to sasari pass in the early meiji period .
kijishi ( wood masters ) formed villages while moving within mountains , but some of them moved to other mountains and it also happened sometimes that an entire village perished due to famine .
here as well , three households moved to nodabata from wakasa , and engaged in manufacturing wooden products , such as dippers .
however , these people had no contact with those in chii village until the middle of the meiji period .
surprised at finding a dipper that had floated down the yura-gawa river , a villager in haino reported it to the office of the head of the village .
an expedition team was organized , and upon " finding " these people , family registers were created in october 0000 .
it is said that the sequence of events was reported in papers at that time as " a present utopia " or " a meiji village . "
** since the meiji period , this area as a whole came to be included in chii village , and the area of this research forest , referred to vaguely as ashiu oku-yama mountain or oroshi-yama mountain , came to be registered in the forest cadaster due to land-tax reform .
this way of using the forest changed gradually after the middle of the meiji period .
the forest business-managing concept that the trees more useful for materials such as japanese cedar or japanese cypress should be planted instead of using other small trees began to take hold , and the vast area of this research forest was targeted for business .
it was difficult for chi village , that had a weak financial base , to conduct business for the vast forest by itself .
therefore , the village attempted to borrow money from banks to finance the business .
however , the area had unfavorable geographical conditions , including a lack of adequate transportation services for shipping lumber .
therefore , the idea of financing the business faded away .
even after that , the issue of forest business was taken up and discussed as a problem to be handled by the village government .
however , the business was never started due to its financial aspect and speculation by powerful persons in the village .
in addition , the people who lived in nodabata had moved down to kuchiki village or natasho village until the end of the meiji period , leaving the place uninhabited .
** on august 00 , 0000 , the present sanin main line started operation between sonobe station and ayabe station , and wachi station was established on the same day .
then , by using trains to transport it from wachi after rafting cut wood down the yura-gawa river to wachi made it possible to cut the cost of transportation and bulk-transportation .
at the same time , demand for chestnut wood indispensable for the railroad ties of railways increased rapidly .
therefore , the following cases increased gradually : chestnut tress in the headwaters area of the yura-gawa river , where trees grew abundantly , were cut and made into railroad ties and then floated down the yura-gaawa river to wachi either as individual pieces or as rafts .
it is said that , the mitsui company noticed this situation and conducted preliminary negotiations with the chii village side from the early to middle of the taisho period to secure the forest resource in ashiu oku-yam mountain .
** in each city , town or village , the integration of properties initially had not progressed smoothly because influential persons ' interests or power relationships among communities either conflicted or complicated the issue .
however , starting at the time when the finance of each of the cities , towns and villages suffered badly after the end of russo-japanese war , integration came to be strongly promoted from the latter half of the meiji period to the taisho and showa periods .
in chii village , school forests were established in 0000 as a basic property of the school , but the movement of the integration of the forests to be owned by communities was promoted through many discussions from the end of the meiji period .
** around this time , kyoto imperial university decided to employ a departmental system , replacing the university system composed of separate colleges , and decided to establish an agricultural faculty in 0000 .
however , at the time , the field practice forests for kyoto imperial university were provided only in taiwan , the korean peninsula and sakhalin , all of which were overseas japanese territories .
therefore , it was strongly requested that a field practice forest be established in japan .
under this situation , a survey to find an area appropriate for the forest was conducted mostly in kyoto prefecture and shiga prefecture , with ashiu oku-yama mountain included as a candidate as well .
in the process of conducting the survey , ashiu oku-yama mountain was rated as being the most appropriate as the site for the field practice forest .
additionally , because ashiu oku-yama mountain was vast and was located at a geographically disadvantageous place , the government side also considered that it would be too much for chii village to manage ashiu oku-yama mountain after the forests owned by the communities were integrated into the village properties .
therefore , considering the status of kyoto imperial university , the kyoto prefectural government negotiated to have ashiu oku-yama mountain selected as the forest-for-field-practice site under the initiative of the kitakuwada county government .
since the actions of the university side coincided with those of the government side , it was decided that ashiu oku-yama mountain should be selected as the forest-for-field-practice site .
then on april 0 , 0000 , an agreement on the creation of surface rights for 00 years was concluded between the university side and the owners of the land ( represented by village headman murai ) .
here , the forest for field practice of kyoto imperial university was begun .
** in this way the field practice forest was launched .
at that time , such forests for field practice of other imperial universities , tokyo university and of hokkaido university , already existed in japan , and these forests were acquired as national properties .
therefore , 000% of the profit from selling the wood cut there became their own income .
this method was selected reluctantly , because kyoto university wanted to catch up to the other universities but there was no financial support available to purchase the vast forest .
therefore , it developed into a big issue as a default of the agreement , and a lawsuit was formed as well .
there was no precedent in kyoto prefecture for the renewal of a contract based on standard price for the right of using the forest land .
therefore , it cannot be denied that this renewal , concluding the contract that included the clause of " paying a fixed amount of money for the right of using the land , " later proved to be a disadvantage for the village side .
however , using this 000 , 000 yen as a fund , the chii village side could achieve the unification of the forests owned by the communities .
in addition , it can also be said that , concerning the village finance in the prewar years , the stable income from the field practice forest contributed significantly to rescue the village finances , which had suffered during the showa depression .
in addition , it can also be said that the establishment of this forest for field practice contributed quite effectively to the creation of job opportunities for residents in ashiu and other local communities .
** on the other hand , regardless of these troubles , facilities had been steadily provided there .
regarding the administration building , the present building was newly built in 0000 .
concerning its business aspect , afforestation business started in 0000 , the cultivation of shiitake mushroom started in 0000 and charcoal making started in 0000 .
concerning the afforestation business , logging initially deteriorated the forest physiognomy and logging was stopped temporarily .
then miscellaneous small trees were cut to cultivate shiitake mushroom and make charcoal , and japanese cedar trees were planted at the site where chestnut tress were cut to make railroad ties .
** a business policy of placing emphasis on academic research was employed for the field practice forest during this era .
of the forests for field practice of kyoto imperial university , camphor was produced in the field practice forest in taiwan , and in the field practice forest in sakhalin , profits were earned from logging .
however it was largely expected that the forest would be made into a site for conducting academic research , and there was a strong movement to attain academic achievements in the field practice forest in ashiu .
therefore , the policy of placing an emphasis on attaining academic achievements rather than pursuing profits from business was employed as " ideal business rather than business for pursuing profits . "
therefore , the university ' s ideal management policy began to be forced to change .
lots of miscellaneous small tress and chestnut trees along the forest tramlines , which started its operation in 0000 , were cut to make charcoal and make railroad ties .
in addition , beech trees were cut as materials to make propellers for airplanes and materials to make containers .
in particular , the amount of charcoal made there had increased year by year , largely exceeding 00 , 000 hyo ( straw bags ) that kyoto imperial university needed yearly in the era between mid-0000s and mid-0000s .
the surplus charcoal was sold in the market , producing precious income , and descriptions of the charcoal appeared even in news papers as " university charcoal . "
after the pacific war started , in order to secure the forest resource to pursue all-out war , the forest tramline was extended to the onokodani area in 0000 to deal with the expansion of the forest area where trees were cut .
such an expansion of the forest area where tress were cut devastated the forest in an increasingly serious manner at the same time .
however , nothing to stop it could be done under the war-time system until the war ended .
** however , little change occurred about the system for the forest for field practice .
on the other hand , the devastating situation of the field practice forest during the war remained unimproved even after the war .
in addition , the forest was further damaged by three typhoons , as one misfortune followed another .
in addition , all sections of the forest tramline to onoko higashidani , which started its operation during the war , were washed out or buried .
in september 0000 , the next year , typhoon jane hit the area , bringing stormy wind comparable to that of typhoon muroto , with many trees fallen due to the wind .
in september 0000 , shortly after that , typhoon 00 in 0000 hit the area .
** these disasters proved to be a big ordeal for the field practice forest , but the construction of facilities and forest roads was promoted together with the work to restore the state of the forest .
in 0000 , along with the forest tramline extension to nodatani , a hydraulic power station was built to start to supply power .
in 0000 , the supply of the electric power to local residents started .
in 0000 , power supply by kansai electric power co . , inc . started .
however , all residents in haino where electric power was not supplied at this time left the village and the village of mountain guardians that had remained also disappeared .
forest roads were laid out centered on the uchisugidani forest road that ran from uchisugidani to chojidani via shimotani .
initially , the portion up to ochiai-bashi bridge was laid out and then the road was extended up to yusen-bashi bridge .
even after that , the work continued over keyaki-toge pass and the road reached the chojidani work site in 0000 .
furthermore , towards 0000s , a forest road opened that , with keyaki-toge pass in the middle of the uchisugi forest road at its center , ran to the immediate foot of sugio-toge pass in the north and to the south side of bunanoki-toge pass in the south .
** the expansion of these forest roads resulted in increasing the forest area where trees were logged .
in and after 0000 when the real development of the forest roads started , the forest area where trees were cut increased rapidly .
it also started the direct sale of standing timber within large areas in 0000 .
the large-scale logging business reached their peak in the latter half of 0000s and around the middle of 0000s .
the peak in the latter half of 0000s , corresponding to the boom period of demand for wood materials , was generated mostly because the market prices of wood remained high during the period .
on the other hand , both natural regeneration and artificial afforestation had been conducted since the start of the field practice forest .
however , such reforestation could not catch up to the expansion in logging areas .
in addition , the value of those planted japanese cedar trees was rated lower than that of naturally-grown ones .
therefore , the natural forests of horse chestnut and zelkova trees were cut one after another .
even after that , the area where trees were planted did increase little , and the value of the trees that were planted did not improve satisfactorily .
in addition , corresponding to an increase in imported wood , the price of domestic wood became stagnant .
therefore , a vicious cycle of expanding the tree-cutting area to increase the profit set in , making the state of the field practice forest further deteriorate .
however , because the compensation was not enough with the general expense on the university side , the forest operation side was therefore forced to conduct unsustainable management .
wood prices then became stagnant , squeezing the business operation of the field practice forest .
therefore , even in the direct management system , the business operation could rid itself of the vicious cycle of logging all trees in the area and then replanting them .
in 0000 , being affected by the energy revolution and the campus strife at that time , the long-lasting charcoal-making business was discontinued .
** as the state of the field practice forest deteriorated even further by large scale logging , not only people on the university side but also the land-owning side began to voice their anxiety and apprehension about the situation .
furthermore , as wood prices remained stagnant for a long period of time , it became difficult to make the yearly payment from the profit to the local communities , even though the logging business continued to be carried out on a large scale .
under this situation , a method of making a payment for land use to the land-owning side was considered , which differed from the previous method in that it involved paying rent on a land lease as opposed to making payment from profits .
in this case , the general revenue resources of the university was desired to pay the rent .
from 0000 , this problem was also discussed repeatedly in the japanese diet as well , and the method of paying rent on a land lease was decided to be introduced from 0000 .
while these activities were underway , the scale of direct business operation of the field practice forest was reduced in and after 0000 , and the area where trees were cut decreased significantly after0000 .
therefore , from the latter half of the 0000s to the early 0000s , the field practice forest came to be used mainly for research purposes again .
** changes in the industrial structure in the high economic growth period and the stagnant wood prices due to imported wood caused the forest industry to decline and the population in forest areas to decrease .
miyama-cho ( former chii village ) was no exception .
the main businesses there , such as the forest industry and the business of making charcoal , continued to decline year by year .
in addition , persons in the area , centered on young persons or those in their prime of life , continued to flow out of the area , decreasing the population , since the area was located close to the keihanshin metropolitan region ,
the company also developed thermal power plants in coastal areas of the metropolitan region .
in addition , the company turned its attention to nuclear power generation as well , and was proactively building nuclear power plants around the wakasa bay .
it was supposed that , even though these measures were taken , a power shortage could occur during peak time .
therefore , a plan to cope with the supposed increase in power demand was formulated that combined the system of pump-up power generation that enabled surplus electric power at night to be used effectively .
then around 0000 , the shimobe dam as a pumped storage power plant was planned to be constructed in natasho village , and also the kamibe dam in shimotani .
each of these plans was presented to persons concerned with kansai electric power .
in accordance with these activities , the property-owing nine-community , which constituted the land owners , requested that the whole field practice forest or an area around shimotani should be returned to the community .
the sightseeing business was also planned to be promoted effectively by using the lake created by the dam .
on the other hand , a campaign was also actively promoted protesting the construction of the dam , for the reason that it would destroy the natural environment on a large scale .
finally , kansai electric power abandoned plans for pump-up power generation , because they could not obtain the understanding of the local people and others .
** as described above , the way of using the field practice forest returned to research-centered one , and the forest roads had been completed to a certain level by the 0000s .
almost no trees were cut since 0000s , and the artificial forests of japanese cedar tress planted in the era when trees were cut on a large scale in 0000s and later have been repopulated .
in addition , work to support naturally-regenerating forests and create artificial forests of broad leaf trees have been conducted experimentally .
furthermore , discussion about plans to construct plants for pumped storage power plant faded away , because the growth of electric power demand in the keihanshin metropolitan region stagnated and awareness towards natural environments changed .
** public opinions concerning natural environments have changed from development-centered ones towards those for the maintenance of or nurturing of environments .
corresponding to these changes , walking in the woods has attracted attention as a way to stay healthy , and mountain climbing has experienced a boom , centered on middle aged persons .
in addition , the tramline has been introduced to railway fans as one of the few remaining forest railways in japan .
even until then , the field practice forest had often been introduced on tv or in news papers , because the place had an image of being " an unexplored region . "
however , few people visited there , due to insufficient road maintenance .
after that , widths of narrow roads were widened , and bypasses developed , that improved vehicle-running conditions .
** in this way , the forest for field practice started attracting people ' s attention and access to the place was improved .
therefore , entering the 0000s , the number of general public entering forest in kinki region , and to this field practice forest where had a large scale natural forest and clear stream remained near big cities increased gradually ,
since around this time , local agents and travel agents plan tours jointly , group visits have also been operated .
to promote the development of the region , in 0000 , entry was permitted by car for tour groups visiting " the nature-and-culture-centered village " in miyama-cho or " the ashiu youth house of kyoto prefecture " , on the condition that they follow all usage rules .
responding to these activities , a course to train the guides for the ashiu forest for research was opened in 0000 , producing 00 guides in the same year .
this activity has been well accepted by the forest-for-research side as they believe it to be useful in explaining the role of the forests to the general public and others .
** furthermore , in the era from the latter half of the 0000s to the early 0000s , a campaign article entitled " the ashiu forest : for world heritage " had been placed in the mainichi newspapers on the " green day ( tree-planting day ) . "
however , an increase in the number of visitors to the forest generated problems in overuse , with undergrowth being trampled , littering , and problems with lavatories and water contamination .
concerning these problems , a memorandum about how to use the forest for research was exchanged in 0000 between " the nature-and-culture-centered village " in miyama-cho and the forest-for-research side .
in this way , measures for these problems , for example , limiting the number of guides and vehicles that can enter the forest , have been taken gradually .
on the other hand , japanese deer , whose number has increased due to the warm winter trend in recent years , generated the following problem : they caused serious food-related damage because they ate out all the young tree buds and undergrowth through spring to summer .
the problems of overuse and food-related damage constituted a big problem for the university side as well , because they will cause the research forest ( field practice forest ) to deteriorate in ways different from those due to large scale logging .
the work site in chojidani was dismantled around 0000 by wearing out .
** the name of the forest was changed from the " forest for field practice " , which was widely used , to the " forest for research " , which is used up to today .
** in the past , it was requested that operation of the research forest finance itself to some extent by earning income by itself and contribute to the finance of the university .
this situation , in addition to the fact that the field practice forest was operated on leased land , caused the vicious cycle in large scale logging as well as deterioration of the forest .
in addition , being open to use by general public has recently caused overuse of the research forest , generating environmental problems within the forest , causing it to deteriorate as a result .
the following describe the issues related to the research forest .
** in particular , kyoto imperial university at that time was behind other universities in opening domestic forest for field practice .
in these situations , it was almost impossible to purchase the land from the land-owning side in order to establish the field practice forest , as other universities already did to establish their domestic forests for field practice .
** as a result this situation produced a breach of contract shortly after the forest of field practice was established .
** after that , when the time to make a yearly payment based on the profit arrived , the forest operation side was pestered to make their payment .
as described above , the value of the wood from the naturally regenerated forests and from the artificially regenerated forests is low , and therefore , it turns out that logging of the natural forest becomes the focus of earnings .
under this situation , wood prices stagnated as well .
in addition , the land was leased .
therefore , when the local community side requested the return of the land that was to be used in constructing a dam to pump water , the problem became so serious that the very existence of the forest itself was threatened .
** when the field practice forest was established , both the university side and the local community side nurtured the dream of " high-profit business based on the field practice forest " and could not get rid of the dream for a long period of time .
it could not be denied that this situation cast a shadow over the management of the forest for field practice .
** in this research forest , there has been a substantial problem in overuse due to the increase in the number of people entering the forest .
the forest was never meant to support a large number of visitors to begin with .
on the other hand , the increase in the number of persons entering this forest is a reflection in the recent mountain-climbing boom .
the style of mountain-climbing tour as a unit of dozens of people has started to be seen also .
in particular , the approach to this site is shorter when the route in the eastern part of this forest for research , running from the takashima city ( former kutsuki-mura ) side to chojidani via jizo-toge peas , is used .
using this route , the core portion of this forest , from kamidani to sugio-toge pass , can be visited easily .
therefore , the number of persons entering this forest from this side has increased .
as a result , the foot paths of kamidani were deeply gullyed by lots of walkers , which has negatively affected the growth of flora there .
in addition , trash and excretion by people entering this forest negatively affect the natural environment of this research forest .
these problems are often seen in areas where people visit seeking natural landscapes , such as the oze wetland and the yakaushima island .
however , historically , it is impossible to shut out all routes to this forest from the takashima city side , and it has made possible since 0000 to enter this forest from the route only via mikuni-toge pass .
** as a result the damage caused by grazing habits of animals , which are eating not only the undergrowth but also the bark of young tress , has been expanding year by year .
if no measures are taken against this problem , the vegetation will be badly affected .
however , with no effective measure existing , it is a difficult problem for which a solution can not be found easily . .

** imperial universities are the universities established according to the imperial university law promulgated in 0000 .
as will be described below , while there was only one university , imperial university was used as the name of the university and after two or more universities were built , it is used as a generic name of a group of universities .
** 0000 to 0000 : name given to the university of tokyo ( established in 0000 ) that was the only university in japan , based on the imperial university law
** 0000 : generic name of the universities established based on the imperial university law
finally , seven universities were built in japan and two universities were built in other countries .
** summary
the imperial universities were established as the top-level national higher education facilities and research organizations in japan .
although there were no ' universities ' or ' graduate schools ' in those days , the imperial university consisted of a university with several major subjects and a graduate school for interdisciplinary researches .
each imperial university developed its organization through incorporating existing institutions of higher education and then reorganized or renamed it or establishing new departments .
in addition to the imperial universities , single-department colleges and others were established in later years , however the universities continued to lead higher education and research in japan .
the name ' imperial university ' was disused after world war ii and the universities became universities that were distinguished or represented each region in japan .
** up to the taisho period , honor students for each course of study were awarded an imperial prize of a silver watch .
gakushikai ( headquartered in tokyo ) was organized as a club of graduates in 0000 .
graduates of former imperial universities are entitled to participate in the club even today .
** until the end of world war ii , the imperial universities ( 帝国大学 ) were abbreviated to teidai ( 帝大 ) .
since the imperial university law was abolished after world war ii , these universities are now called ' former imperial universities ' or ' kyuteidai ' .
the former imperial universities may or may not include the imperial universities in keijo ( old name of seoul city in the period of japan ' s rule ) and taipei in the former foreign parts .

the imperial diet was organized in 0000 and a lot of ' proposals ' for establishment of imperial universities were submitted to the diet .
if drafts of proposals were adopted and became ' proposals , ' it meaned that the congress showed its intension to the government under the constitution of the empire of japan , and they were not draft laws and therefore were not legally binding .
** minister of education sukenori kabayama of the second yamagata cabinet that was organized in 0000 at the stage of establishment of kyoto imperial university told that he wished to establish imperial universities in the tohoku and kyushu regions .
he expressed his intension to establish an imperial university in miyagi prefecture in tohoku where the former second high school ( daini koto gakko ) existed , but did not mention to the prefecture in which to establish one in kyushu .
the governors of fukuoka prefecture where yahata iron factory was located and nagasaki prefecture where the former fifth high school faculty of medicine existed said that ' we are prepared for donating 000 , 000 yen ' .
kumamoto prefecture where the headquarters of the former fifth high school existed offered to provide land .
however , the imperial diet expressed their negative views and the establishment of both imperial universities was abandoned because ' even if it is established by donation , operating expenses could not be worked out . '
** the opposition party , the seiyu party ( president hirobumi ito ) , submitted a ' proposal of establishing kyushu and tohoku imperial universities ' and a ' proposal of establishing hokkaido imperial university ' in the 00th imperial diet in 0000 .
the proposals were passed at the house of representatives special committee , and a request to establish imperial universities in tohoku , kyushu and hokkaido was expressed from the diet to the government .
however , the government expressed their negative views because the request was made by the opposition party , the proposal was not legally binding and japan was in recession in 0000 to 0000 .
on the contrary , the diet adopted a ' proposal of establishing hokkaido imperial university ' in 0000 , and a ' proposal of establishing tohoku imperial university ' in 0000 to appeal to the government .

seven universities athletic meet ( abbreviated as nanataisen or nanateisen ) in which seven universities competed periodically was performed every year .
** some imperial universities were established by the initiative of the government , the diet adopted a lot of proposals of establishing imperial universities and appealed the establishment to the government .
however , the proposals were not legally binding , higher education facilities other than imperial universities could be established at a relatively low cost , but a large amount of money was required to establish imperial universities because they were highly rated .
therefore , it was difficult to establish imperial universities soon with a proposal of establishing the imperial universities in the diet because it did not have financial prospects .

** kyusei koto gakko was an institution of higher education in japan based on the higher school order ( in 0000 and 0000 ) that existed until 0000 .
** summary
the educational content was equivalent to the educational curriculum of first and second years in present-day college .
however , considering the moral tone and the status of the students back then , it can be said that this type of institution does not exist in the modern era , where upper secondary education has become popularized .
it is often confused with high school , but the modern-day high school is an institution of secondary education , and therefore it is equivalent to the school of secondary education under the old system ( it is typified by middle school under the old system ) .
** among the seven national higher middle schools , which included the first through the fifth schools and the ones in yamaguchi and kagoshima established in 0000 by the middle school order , the six schools excluding the one in kagoshima were reorganized into higher schools in 0000 .
** there were two systems at the beginning , consisting of specialized course ( four years ) and university preparatory course ( three years ) .
however , the specialized course was either successively abolished ( they were upgraded to imperial universities ) or divided into specialized schools , and all that was left was university preparatory course , where preparatory education for imperial universities took place .
when the higher school order was amended in 0000 , many more were established in various areas .
seven-year higher schools came into existence , and ' university preparatory course ' was renamed to ' advanced course . '
** according to the higher school order of 0000 , higher schools were defined as institutions where education of specialized courses took place , and preparatory education for students to be enrolled in the imperial universities was stipulated by a provisional clause .
the specialized course was modeled after colleges in england and in the u . s . with the primary goal of providing specialized education , and it was expected to play the role of ' the highest educational institution at the regional level ' ( regional university ) .
** an example of an educational institution , that offered this specialized course that reflected its character as defined by the higher school order , was the third higher school ( under the old system ) .
the third higher school began , at the beginning , with specialized faculties of only law , engineering and medicine .
the third higher school was the only school that did not have a history of having a university preparatory course .
** in 0000 , kinmochi saionji suggested to upgrade the third higher school to kyoto university using the reparations obtained from the sino-japanese war .
consequently , the third higher school university preparatory course was established on the southern side of higashi ichijo-dori street ( current kyoto university yoshida minami campus ) .
the suggestion that the premises , buildings and facilities of the third higher school faculty of law and engineering be used by kyoto imperial university was adopted , and the budget was approved in the following year .
** the imperial edict related to the establishment of kyoto imperial university was issued on june 00 , 0000 , and kyoto imperial university was inaugurated .
the third higher school faculty of medicine , which was located in okayama , branched out and became independent as okayama medical college in 0000 .
in other higher schools the specialized faculties and university preparatory courses were completely separated , and higher schools became institutions of higher education that provided only preparatory education for imperial universities .
the role of specialized faculties at higher schools under the old system as regional educational institutions of specialized higher education would be played by the specialized schools under the old system and the imperial universities that would later be established in increasing numbers in local regions .
** the higher school order that was reformed in 0000 , aimed to fulfill the national morality of men and to perfect the higher ordinary education .
moreover , the establishment of public and private higher schools was permitted , and they continued to grow until the end of the world war ii .
** the essence of these higher schools was a system that guaranteed one ' s admittance into an imperial university .
throughout the pre-war period there was almost a one-to-one ratio between the number of students per year at higher schools under the old system and that of the imperial universities .
therefore , as long as there was a diploma for completing a higher school , one could enter an imperial university without any examinations as long as he was not choosey about the field of study ,
because there was this type of ' guarantee of status ' there were students who did not study hard but enjoyed their student lives .
** moreover , it also served as an incubator for the elites in the pre-war society , and it was an institution that supported the foundation of social system at the time .
** there was also university preparatory course , which was a similar institution .
however , it was a different institution , because unlike the higher school under the old system , there was a premise that the students would be admitted to specific universities under the old system .
** inauguration
its beginning was the preparatory school of the university of tokyo ( tokyo yobimon ) that ministry of education created in tokyo .
the instructors at the university of tokyo in the early years were mostly foreigners hired from western countries at ' salaries higher than those of ministers . '
the curriculum was modeled after universities in europe , and textbooks , lectures , notes and answers were all in foreign languages .
therefore , in order to receive a specialized education , it was absolutely necessary to be highly proficient in languages such as english and german .
university preparatory school was a preparatory educational institution to acquire such language skills .
** in order to improve the bureaucratic organization , hirobumi ito , who acquired power after ousting shigenobu okuma at the coup in 0000 , merged all of the national schools in tokyo with the university of tokyo , which had been created by ministry of education .
he renamed it an ' imperial university , ' which was the only university , and he designated it as a training institution for government officials and scholars .
the university of tokyo becoming an ' imperial university ' meant that a preparatory educational institution was to be placed in each of the five school districts throughout japan .
preparatory school of the university of tokyo became the first higher middle school within district number one ( the kanto region and the areas around it ) , and it later became the first high school under the old system by the higher school order .
refer to higher middle school for details on the predecessor of higher schools .
** enticement battle
because they were at an advantage compared to the schools that were established later , they were called ' number schools ' ( from ' n school ' ) in order to distinguish them from other schools .
** therefore , even after the new system was put in place the honorific title such as ' number school elite school ' remained in idiomatic usage .
schools that are numbered , which are mainly public high schools ( some private schools also ) , including the period of middle schools in each municipality under the old system , are sometimes locally called ' the number school of xx . '
** after the sixth higher school ( under the old system ) the local eagerness to entice the schools had a large influence on its establishment .
on enticing the sixth higher school , okayama and hiroshima competed with each other .
in the diet , it is said that the parliamentarians got into a scuffle outside the diet building .
** in the case of the seventh higher school ' zoshikan school ' ( under the old system ) , it was substantially decided to be in matsumoto , but it had not been publicly disclosed .
however , it was hastily changed to kagoshima for various reasons .
moreover , for the establishment of the ninth higher school , a fierce enticement battle took place between niigata and matsumoto , and it became a series of smearing campaigns ,
however , in the end , using the name ' the ninth higher school ' was avoided , and the matter was settled by using the place name of niigata higher school ( under the old system ) and matsumoto higher school ( under the old system ) .
** this matter was taken into consideration in the naming of schools established since then , and the schools were named according to the location of the school .
as a way to contrast and distinguish these from the ' number schools ' mentioned earlier , they were sometimes called ' chimeiko ' ( place name schools ) or ' name schools . '
** the second higher school order ( amendment to the higher school order )
the second higher school order was proclaimed on december 0 , 0000 , and it was enforced on april 0 , 0000 .
as for the characteristic of the higher schools , it was laid out as ' a higher school is a place where one receives higher ordinary education . '
as for the structure of higher schools the standard was set as a seven-year system with three years of advanced course and four years of regular course .
schools that consisted of only advanced course were also allowed as an exception .
a regular course was comparable to the curriculum of middle school , and therefore , establishing of university preparatory course was allowed .
the graduates of advanced course were allowed to have a training period limited to one year in their specialty , and those who completed this training period was awarded with the title of tokugyoshi .
** the qualification required for entering advanced course was completion of regular course at a higher school or about four years of middle school ( before the reform , completion of middle school which was five years at the time ) , and shortening of the enrollment period was realized .
this shortening of the number of years spent on the training preexisted at the basis of the reform of higher school educational system .
therefore , it became common for the students wanting to enter higher schools to take the higher school entrance examinations , assuming that it would end in four years , and many people were accepted .
** the qualification for entering the regular course was completion of elementary school ( national school ) or equivalent .
** the entrance to school was set to take place in april .
** higher schools other than national schools
after 0000 it became possible to establish higher schools by groups of people other than the government .
for public schools , there is toyama kenritsu toyama koto gakko ( toyama prefectural toyama high school ) ( under the old system ) which was established by a wealthy local family who donated an enormous amount of money to the prefecture .
furthermore , gakushuin , established by imperial household ministry during the meiji period , was set up in order to educate the children of the peers , but after 0000 , it became an institution equivalent to the higher schools under the old system .
** many of the national higher schools , starting with the first higher school , had only three years of advanced course , which was consistent with the structure of the original schools .
** its end
** after world war ii ended , with the influence of american occupation policy some higher schools under the former system began to admit women to enroll .
female students went to school wearing student ' s hats that were the same as the male student ' s , or they wore brimless student ' s hats .
in general , female students were treated well as guests , and many went on to imperial universities or universities under the new system , then became teachers and researchers .
** however , an end was coming near even to higher schools of the old system .
shigeru nanbara , who was vice chairman of education reform committee worked actively toward their abolition .
nanbara repeatedly stated his commitment to inazo nitobe , the principal of ichiko when nanbara was a student there , who emphasized that men should be gentlemen .
it can be seen that he was uncomfortable with the atmosphere of rudeness .
** because of the post-war educational reform , the former higher schools merged with former universities and other institutions of higher education , and many of them became parent organizations such as faculties of general education , literature or science at universities under the new system .
** furthermore , yoji yamada , a film director , encountered the educational reform while he was still a student at yamaguchi higher school , and he moved on to the university of tokyo from tokyo metropolitan koyamadai high school under the new system . .
** before the implementation of the educational reform , there was a movement to search for a way for the former higher schools to continue their existence as ' junior colleges ' ( equivalent to junior colleges after the reform ) , but it ended as a dream .
** the graduates who reminisced over the former higher schools proclaimed the positive aspects of the former higher schools by holding nihon ryokasai ( song festival held by the dormitory students ) and by founding ' association to advance the educational revolution in japan ' even after the war .
however , perhaps because they adamantly aspired to revive the former higher schools as national institutions of higher education , there were no movements toward establishing specialized higher schools and junior colleges for liberal arts education in private schools for the benefit of the elites .
yet , such schools did exist in public schools .
wakayama prefectural junior college of sciences was one such school that was established in 0000 but it was abolished in 0000 .
** the establishment of the university of tokyo , faculty of liberal arts under the new system was a movement to preserve the tradition of liberalism in the former higher schools .
** entrance examination , academic curriculum and graduation
entrance examination
in 0000 , the ' integrated selection system ' was adopted in the entrance examinations for higher schools .
the ' integrated selection system ' was abolished in 0000 , but from the following year , the examination questions were standardized for all schools except for the seventh high school .
** from 0000 , in order to accommodate the students taking examinations to go to national higher schools , the national higher schools were divided into two groups , and one school from each group was allowed to be specified .
the first group consisted of the first , the fifth , the seventh , niigata , mito , yamagata , matsue , tokyo , osaka , urawa , shizuoka , himeji and hiroshima higher schools .
the second group consisted of the second , the third , the fourth , the sixth , the eighth , matsumoto , yamaguchi , matsuyama , saga , hirosaki , fukuoka and kochi higher schools .
** class composition
** university preparatory course was divided into the first division ( law , literature ) , the second division ( engineering , science , agriculture ) and the third division ( medicine ) .
because of the influence of the amendment to the higher school order , the university preparatory course was renamed as advanced course .
faculty of sciences german category was set up as the way to advance to faculty of medicine and faculty of pharmaceutical sciences .
however , the higher schools that had divisions with french as the primary foreign language were few in number , such as the first higher school , the third higher school , shizuoka higher school , fukuoka higher school , osaka higerh school and urawa higher school .
** the class composition at the fourth higher school in 0000 was two classes in english literature , one class in german literature , three science classes in english and one science class in german .
** graduation and college entrance examination
** the enrollment capacity at imperial universities was about the same as the number of graduates from the former higher schools , and therefore , as long as one was not picky about the desired field of study , enrollment at an imperial university after graduation was guaranteed .
therefore , depending on the faculty at regional imperial universities and national colleges there was a shortage of students .
universities that were established later , such as keijo imperial university and hokkaido imperial university , independently took up strategies to set up ' yoka ' ( preparatory course ) in order to ensure a pool of talented students from early on .
** in the 0000 ' s , the national medical colleges that were established during the early period were upgraded to national medical universities .
as with imperial universities ( except for the universities with their own preparatory courses such as hokkaido imperial university , keijo imperial university and taipei imperial university ) , the medical schools did not have their own preparatory courses .
in order to go to these universities it was necessary to have graduated from a higher school under the old system .
because of the emergence of ' regional imperial universities with preparatory courses ' and ' national medical colleges without preparatory courses , ' equating graduation from former higher school and going to an imperial university no longer worked .
** in general , because there were many applicants to the medical schools and to the popular divisions at the university of tokyo and kyoto university , acceptance rate was often one out of two or one out of three .
however , in the case of university tokyo faculty of law , the examination subjects were only translation from english to japanese and from japanese to english .
put in today ' s words , it was similar to examinations for getting into seminars .
upon advancing to popular faculties and departments , more than a few people became ronin ( those who could not pass the examinations to enroll at a university ) , and they were called white-line ronin .
** when there was an under-enrollment at imperial universities the capacity was filled preferentially by the graduates and the potential graduates of former higher schools .
during the applicant selection process at imperial universities priority was decided based on the applicant ' s educational history .
if the enrollment limit was exceeded by the applicant with first priority ranking , a competitive examination was given to those with first priority ranking .
the ones who failed the tests became members of ronin , and they were sometimes called ' hakusen ronin ' ( ronin with white lines ) .
if the enrollment limit was not met by the first priority applicants , then these first priority applicants were all accepted , and the shortage in the enrollment was filled by the second priority applicants .
for students with priority rankings lower than the second priority , the method of determining the priority based on the educational history was dependent on the university and the department .
in many cases , the second priority and below were designated as ' people with educational history other than graduates of higher schools , ' and those who enrolled in this manner were called ' people who were admitted through indirect enrollment . '
therefore , applicants from higher normal schools and higher technical schools were admitted to fill the enrollment capacity in form , but at imperial universities they were permitted to enroll , using the fill-ins as a reason and treating them as indirect enrollments .
there were relatively many cases of indirect enrollment at imperial universities other than the university of tokyo and kyoto university .
** with the changeover to the new system because of the educational reform , a measure was taken against the white-line ronin ( november 00 , 0000 , notified by the ministry of education ) .
each university under the old system was divided into two terms , and in 0000 , the selection examinations were given .
each university under the old system increased the enrollment limit as much as possible , and in order to prevent double enrollment and rescinding of enrollment , the university made the announcement of acceptance as soon as possible for the first term .
the actions taken against the white-line ronin by the universities under the old system ended with the entrance examination in 0000 .

** the cap had either two or three stripes , and it was a symbol of higher school student under the old system .
however , some private higher school students under the old system did not have the white stripes on their caps , and students at seijo high school who were unhappy about this started a ' white stripes movement . '
on the other hand , the caps with white stripes at nihon university preparatory course looked exactly the same those of higher schools under the old system .
** the middle school order was officially announced on april 00 , 0000 .
by this , national higher middle schools ( precursor to higher schools under the old system ) were established in each of the five school districts throughout japan as well as in yamaguchi and kagoshima .
** in 0000 , preparatory school of the university of tokyo , its extension campus in osaka ( later moved to kyoto ) and yamaguchi junior highs school were renamed the first higher middle school , the third higher middle school and yamaguchi higher middle school , respectively .
in the following year of 0000 , the second higher middle school ( sendai ) , the fourth higher middle school ( kanazawa ) , the fifth higher middle school ( kumamoto ) , kagosima higher middle zoshikan school were established one after another .
** the number on each school refers to the school district number ( there were changes depending on the time period ) from first one to fifth , and numbers sixth through eighth were given chronologically according to their establishment .
there was a specialized courses set up at schools from the first to the fifth higher schools at the time , which were established in the early years .
in april of 0000 , the school district system was abolished , and it became possible to take entrance examinations for higher schools unrestricted by the school districts .
** while enjoying the economic growth because of world war i , japan also experienced a great advancement in industrial power , and consequently , there was a societal demand to build more imperial universities and increase the student enrollment limit .
with this demand , it became necessary to increase the number of higher schools .
in 0000 , under the hara cabinet , the ' foundation and expansion plan of higher schools in the miscellaneous category ' with an enormous additional budget of 00 . 0 million yen ( currency ) was submitted to the imperial diet and it was approved .
** later , this plan was almost completely realized .
** during this time , there was a fight over the name of ' the ninth high school ' between niigata and matsumoto , and the use of numbers was abandoned and the place name was used instead .
thus , the name schools were born .
another reason was the fact that distinction using numbers became difficult due to an increase in the number of higher schools .
** institutionally , the seven-year higher school ( four years of regular course and three years of advanced course ) was defined as an institution of higher education , but it effectively served as an institution of both middle and higher education in one school .
** there are also criticisms that seven-year high schools created young writers and exam-ready brains who were sophisticated but lacked substance .
** tokyo higher school regular course was abolished only 00 years after classes started and only 00 years after it was established .
later , osaka prefectural naniwa higher school regular course and the regular course at toyama high school , which changed its status from public to national , were abolished one after another ( tokyo higher school regular course temporarily restarted taking in applicants after the war ) .
the only national or public schools that taught the regular course were the taipei higher school , which was under the jurisdiction of the taiwan governor-general , and the prefectural higher school established by the prefecture of tokyo .
** among the group of higher schools under the old system that included institution of primary education were konan , seijo and seikei .
entrance into these elementary schools was directly linked to moving onto imperial universities , including tokyo imperial university , and they became very popular .
ichiro kato , who later became the president of the university of tokyo , also went from seijo elementary school ( current seijo gakuen elementary school ) on to seijo higher school .
although not higher school under the old system , gakushuin also included an institution of primary education .
** it is generally regarded that at the educational reform advanced courses moved on to become universities under the new system , and the regular courses moved on to become middle schools and high schools .
** gakushuin junior high school ( under the former system ) and gakushuin high school ( under the former system ) ( current gakushuin high school and gakushuin university , respectively ) of incorporated educational institution of gakushuin
gakushuin is a national school founded on gakushuin school system .
furthermore , it was a special educational institution under the direct jurisdiction of imperial household ministry .
at the beginning , there were primary course ( six years ) , junior high course ( six years at the beginning , then five years ) , supplementary course , higher course and special college course ( abolished in 0000 ) .
however , in 0000 , the schools were renamed to primary , junior high and high schools , and this system continued until the implementation of school education law .
** according to the gakushuin school system , at the beginning , the supplementary course and the higher course were regarded as two-year educational institutions for students who graduated from the junior high course .
from the meiji period to the taisho period , advancement to an imperial university was not completely guaranteed .
the graduates of higher course were permitted to go on to an imperial university when the student enrollment capacity was not filled at the imperial university , or only by recommendation of the university president , and there was no standard system of advancement .
** order of ministry of education article number 00 in 0000 guaranteed students institutional permission to advance to imperial universities just as other graduates of higher course of higher schools under the old system .
** after world war ii , education in medicine and dentistry were taught at universities ( universities under the old system ) .
medical colleges under the former system and colleges of dentistry under the former system were upgraded to universities under the old system .
however , some among these schools did not fulfill the standards to be upgraded to universities , and such schools were transformed into higher schools under the old system in order to save the matriculated students .
they are called post-war specially established high schools ( however , tokushima national higher school became a higher school through a different route ) .
they were considered as preparatory courses for medical universities , and they were partially included into the universities under the new system that were established during the educational reform .
** university preparatory courses
** while they were similar to higher schools under the old system ( those established by the university order ) , they were institutions of higher education with the understanding that their students would advance only to the universities with which they were separately associated .
this point was institutionally very different from higher schools under the old system .

besides these schools , there were many other normal schools , established independently by each prefecture , for training elementary school teachers , but there was no uniformity in the period of education and entrance age .

** therefore , normal schools in various regions , on the model of american universities such as " liberal arts colleges " , made a fresh start as department of education or department of liberal arts of new-system universities that embodied various old-system schools .
therefore , at this time , many schools replaced teachers extensively , and the campuses of normal/youth and normal schools in a prefecture are integrated in series , as a result school traditions changed greatly .
** the current system allows students in every department to get a teacher ' s license .
as a result , however , some people pointed out that this system produced incompetent teachers who had not majored in pedagogy , and some proposed that the normal school system be revived .

a monument of kobe naval training center is at kyobashisuji minamizume .
** although katsu was a shogun ' s retainer , he foresaw collapse of the bakufu and many patriots of forces of overthrowing the shogunate gathered to him .
kobe which had been a fishing village began to develop as a port town since this training center was established in kobe .
there is an episode as follows .
katsu foresaw it , and advised the locals who took care of him there that ' you had better buy lands before it ' s too late . '
thereafter , the price of the lands jumps well , and the persons raised big profit .
** however , the choshu domain , which had lost its position in coup of august 00 , was accused of having attacked kyoto , kinmon incident .
katsu was dismissed as government ' s naval magistrate .
** some researcher such as rei matsuura and hiroshi shinohara proposes an opinion that a private school of kaishu katsu and kobe naval training center should be considered individually .
** ryoma sakamoto : a leading student of the private school
he was found by kaishu katsu , and learned seamanship , but learned it almost in his own way .
he was disappointed at closing of the training center that was the stage of youth after leaving the domain and dismissal of katsu as his teacher .
thereafter , he began working seriously in movement to overthrow the shogunate .
after the training center was dissolved , he formed kameyama shachu using experiences here .
however , adopting the opinions of such as rei matsuura , ryoma was not able to enter kobe naval training center , and was not a leading student of the private school of kaishu katsu .
in fact , it is thought that not ryoma but yonosuke sato was managed the private school of kaishu katsu .
however , katsu himself told in " hikawa seiwa " that ryoma sakamoto was a leading student of the private school .
it may be impossible to think sakamoto had no relationship with the kobe naval training center or the private supplementary school associated with it .
** munemitsu mutsu : he became the vice chief class by favor of sakamoto .
he had a role of a secretary of ryoma .
he became minister of foreign affairs later at the time of the sino-japanese war .
** sukeyuki ( yuko ) ito : he is from satsuma domain .
he became the first navarch of combined fleet , and commanded the battle of the yellow sea ( sino-japanese war ) .

** the book of medicine , " kaitai shinsho ( new book of anatomy ) , " published 00 years after the lifting of the ban , salvaged the situation .
the doctors such as ryotaku maeno and genpaku sugita succeeded to translate the western book of medicine , " ontleedkundige tafelen " by self-study .
before that , even though the ban had been lifted , if they acted openly they could be considered as ones with traitorous intention against the edo bakufu and immediately subjected to penalties .
however , because of the success , many disciples gathered to study with genpaku sugita , and with the need of a private school for their training , rangakujuku , ' tenshinro ( 天真楼 ) ' was established .
** gentaku otsuki , one of the disciples of ryotaku maeno and genpaku sugita , established a private school called ' shirando ( 芝蘭堂 ) ' after finished studying in ' tenshinro . '
many rangakujuku were established from those rangakujuku ( tenshinro , shirando ) in the late edo period when people were anxious to bring in knowledge of overseas
in particular , keiogijuku university originated in a rangakujuku and the word ' juku ' still means the university because of this fact .

in the initial stage , the school was expected to accommodate 000 students , however , the number of the students was reduced to 00 due to its financial circumstances .
in july 0000 , 00 students were accommodated and were provided with the education on law mainly about french law .
some of the students left the school in the middle of the course and some students were newly recruited and , therefore , the total number of the students registered was 00 .

following the graduation of the students of the inaugural class , the second generation students entered .
from the second generation students , the term of study was laid down as eight years ( four years for the preparatory course and four years for the main course ) .
the capacity of the school was expanded from 00 to 000 students .
the preparatory course provided the ordinary education including that of french language as the core and the main course provided law education in french .
the person in charge of the law education was a french employee of the national government , georges appert .
the second generation students graduated in july 0000 , however the number of graduates was 00 ( 00 bachelors of law and four students just finished the courses ) of the 000 students who had entered .

there were about 000 public and private schools of this kind throughout japan .
** summary
in those days , one of the school songs of the ministry of education , a children ' s song ' akatonbo ' ( red dragonfly ) illustrates , it was common for school age children of today to take care of younger children all day long .
** in 0000 , with ' the education order , ' the japanese government launched the modern school system , but the enrollment rate didn ' t rise as they expected .
the biggest reason was that the children , especially girls , were told by their parents to baby-sit their little brothers and sisters or other families ' children at their workplaces , and that this burden prevented them from going to school .
** the little children brought by the girls were also provided with nursery education there .
in 0000 , the following year , he published the book " komori kyoiku ho " -methods for educating little baby-sitters ( from fukyu-sha publishing , reprinted edition in 0000 ) .
after that , schools of this kind spread to 00 administrative divisions , and they continued to exist till the end of the taisho period or the biginning of the showa period .
** the baby-sitter school in ueda city , nagano prefecture has the longest history -00 years 0month .
there is also an example like kyoto college of economics which started out as a private baby-sitter school , and transformed itself occasionally , and has existed till today .
** when establishing a school was impossible , a class was formed .
it was confirmed that there were such classes in 00 administrative divisions at the time .
** development into night schools and nursery schools
baby-sitting children were from poor farming or fishing villages , and their parents didn ' t value education out of ignorance , and therefore in many cases , they didn ' t welcome baby-sitter schools .
** baby-sitter schools didn ' t have staff to take care of the babies during class .
there were no such arrangements at public schools , while private schools gradually started giving their attention to the matter .
in 0000 , in niigata city , atsutomi akazawa and his wife , nakako opened a nursery institution in affiliate with niigata seishu school .
( its name was changed into shuko fudoku yochiji hogokai in 0000 . )
it was the first nursery school in japan .
** baby-sitter schools were established under the special circumstances with the socio-economic background .
they have unique significance in the japanese history of education as the ones which encouraged the birth of night schools and nursery schools .

** the shakaku system based on the engi-shiki
the shikinaisha are those shrines were entitled to offerings at kinen-sai ; there were 0 , 000 of them listed .
this signifies that the imperial court placed importance on these shrines at the time .
those that enshrine myojin ( gods ) , long thought to have a remarkably miraculous efficacy , are all included in the shikinaisha , and are calledmyojin taisha shrine ( myojidai ) .
** thekanpei-sha shrine are the shrines that received offerings from the jingikan ( the department of divinities ) ; and the kokuhei-sha shrine are those that received offerings from the kokushi ( local governors ) .
each shrine was ranked by major ( dai ) and minor ( sho ) .
at first all shrines got offerings directly from the jingikan ; but because it took time to travel to shrines in distant districts , the kokushi began to conduct offerings on behalf of the jingikan , creating the distinction between kanpeisha and kokuheisha .
however , some important shrines became kanpeisha , even if they were in distant districts .
** the order of shakaku is as follows .
** kanpei-taisha shrine
** kokuhei-taisha shrine
** kanpei-shosha shrine
** kokuhei-shosha shrine
** ichinomiya
ichinomiya was the most powerful shrine in the country of ryo-sei ( the political system based on the ritsuryo codes ) .
when a kokushi began his appointment , he had to make a pilgrimage to the shrines ( called sinpai ) in his district .
the most influential shrine in the district came to be called ichinomiya , as it was the first that he would visit ; some districts had ninomiya and also sannomiya .
as there were no clear criteria , it changed throughout history , according to the ups and downs of the shrines .
it began in the provinces in the late heian period , and was eventually established in the kinai area too .
** soja
because it took the kokushi a long time to visit all of the shrines in the district , they were enshrined together in the vicinity of provincial government offices .
it was called soja .
** kokushi-hoheisha shrine
the kokushi hoheisha are the shrines that are listed in kokunai jimmyo-cho of each district .
kokunai jimmyo-cho is a list of the shrines that the kokushi visited when he made his pilgrimage .

ichinomiya
** honchi-suijaku
** anti-honchi-suijaku
** honchi indicates the state of enlightenment , while suijaku , which literally means " bringing down jaku ( ato ) , " indicates the appearance of shinto and buddhist deities .
the ultimate honchi is considered to be hossin ( the truth of the universe ) and is therefore called honchi-hossin .
as the " gon " of gongen means " provisional " or " temporary , " as shown in " gon-dainagon ( an acting chief councilor of state ) , gongen indicates a buddha that has tentatively appeared in the form of a god .
** the concept of honchi originated from the inclusive nature of buddhism , which encompassed a wide range of indigenous religions as it spread throughout the region .
this is evidenced by the fact that most buddhist tenbu ( deva ) gods originate from hindu , india ' s indigenous religion .
the thought also gave rise to a theory of esoteric buddhism ( of the later mahayana buddhism ) that kajishin like fudo myo-o ( acala ) is the embodiment of dainichi nyorai ( vairocana ) .
** it was seng-zhao , of the late qin , who first brought the concept to buddhism .
** this created a widely accepted view that hon is the buddha or enlightenment itself while jaku is simply a means by which to save and enlighten people .
** in japan , as is evident in the confrontation between the mononobe clan and the soga clan during the nara era , there has been a dividing line between shinto and buddhism since it was officially introduced to japan .
however , the line was gradually eroded as the buddhists took the view that shinto gods are a kind of lost , poor people , like the tenbu ( deva ) gods .
they tried to raise their status to that of the buddha by leaving copies of sutras at temples or doing doso , officially acknowledging the gods ' achievements and stating in oracles that they would no longer stay as a god thanks to buddha ' s good deeds .
** because these gods were considered to be members of the goho zenjin , a group of gods who respected and guarded the buddhist law , some were even granted bosatsu-go ( the title of bodhisattva ) from the end of the nara era through the heian era .
a typical example of this is hachimanshin , a famous ethnic god also known as hachiman daibosatsu .
** however , some low-profile minor ethnic gods , like the spirits of nature and death , to whom the honchi-suijaku theory was not applied , were treated differently .
they are , for example , jitsurui no kami ( jitsurui gods ) or jissha no kami ( jissha gods ) , as opposed to gonsha no kami .
to make their position clear , some buddhists codified a warning that permitted people to respect gongeshin but not jitsurui no kami .
this must have been an intentional effort to keep buddhism separate from shinto .
** the theory of honji-suijaku affected art and architecture , giving birth to honchi-suijaku zuga ( pictures ) and gongen-zukuri ( buildings ) , and during the middle and end of the kamakura era it affected literature as well , resulting in a series of works called honchimono .
** by the middle of the kamakura era there appeared a group of people who insisted in the shinpon butsujaku theory that buddhas were in turn the embodiment of shinto gods and that shinto gods were the masters that buddhas followed .
this theory was originated by shinto people who had complained about buddhism , which had been dominant over shinto , and wanted shinto to achieve independent status from it .
** from the period of the northern and southern courts through the muromachi era , the anti-honchi-suijaku theory increasingly gained ground to the point where some monks of the tendai sect supported it .
following these moves , kanetomo yoshida wrote the book titled " yuiitsu shinto myoho yoshu ( the only shinto scripture ) , " making jihen ' s theory more complete and comprehensive .
however , new buddhist schools that emerged during the kamakura era supported the honchi-suijaku theory as they were supposed to do .
** note that the anti-honchi-suijaku theory was given its name by the scholars of the showa era .
** suijakushin ( the god of suijaku ) and honchibutu ( the buddha of honchi )
the buddha , the identity of the gods , is called honchibutsu .
buddhas that are forcibly linked to shinto gods are different from religion to religion , faith to faith , temple to temple and shrine to shrine .
** although the most popular buddhist title granted to japanese gods is bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) , some of them--like hachiman daibosatsu , whose honchibutsu title is amida nyorai ( amitabha ) --carry a honchibutsu title that differs from the corresponding buddhist title .
** the following shows some of the relationships between suijakushin and honchibutsu :
** amaterasu = dainichi nyorai ( vairocana ) + juichimen kannon bosatsu
hachimanshin = amida nyorai ( amitabha ) = emperor ojin
kumano gongen = amida nyorai ( amitabha )
oyama kui no kami = amaterasu omikami = dainichi nyorai ( vairocana )
ichikishima-hime = benzaiten ( sarasvati )
atagoo gongen = akiba gongen = jizo bosatsu ( jizo bodhisattva )
susanoo = gozu tenno
okuninushi = daikokuten ( mahakala )
tosho daigongen ( ieyasu tokugawa ) = yakushi nyorai ( bhaisaya )
matsuo taisha shrine = yakushi nyorai ( bhaisaya )
** amaterasu omikami
** summary
** changes in divinity
** " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan )
** the modern age
** amaterasu omikami ( tensho daijin ) is a humanized shinto god in japanese .
in " engishiki ( list of official shrines ) , " " amaterasu " of amaterasu omikami is cited as " amateru " when worshipped as the god of nature .
** amaterasu omikami is the god of the sun and one of the oyagami ( parent deities ) of the imperial family ( the kososhin ( imperial ancestor ) ) .
in " kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , " amaterasu omikami is referred to as 天照大御神 whereas in " nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) " the god is cited as 天照大神 .
another name given to her is ohirumenomuchi no kami .
** in " nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , " amaterasu omikami is referred to under different names , whereas in " kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) " she is consistently cited as " 天照大御神 . "
amaterasu omikami is considered to be female , but some say the god is male .
** in academic documents she is now customarily spelled " アマテラス " in katakana .
some say that in old days she was cited as 天照太神 .
** how amaterasu omikami is described in myths
** according to " kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , " amaterasu omikami was born from izanagi as she rinsed her left eye when safely returning from yomi ( the world after death ) where izanami lived , in order to remove the dirt .
at this time , tsukuyomi was born from her right eye and susanoo from her nose , and the three together have come to be called mihashira no uzuno miko ( three noble children ) .
izanagi then instructed amaterasu omikami to rule takamanohara .
** because susanoo—who had been instructed to rule unabara ( the sea ) —kept crying , saying he wanted to go to the land of the roots ( the land of izanami ) , he was finally expelled by izanagi .
although susanao ascended to takamanohara to meet amaterasu omikami , his elder sister , on the way to the land of the roots , amaterasu omikami , who assumed her brother was coming to deprive her of takamanohara , armed herself and waited for him .
after susanoo made a pledge to prove that he had no such intention , five male gods were born from amaterasu omikami ' s monozane ( the media from which gods are given birth ) and three female gods from that of susanoo , and susanoo declared victory .
** the following are the five gods considered to be born from amaterasu omikami ' s monozane and are therefore her children :
** amenooshihomimi
amenohohi
amatsuhikone
ikutsuhikone
kumanokusubi
** susanoo , swept up by the event , became wild and violent at takamanohara , causing his sister to hide herself in ama no iwato ( the cave of heaven ) .
this threw the entire world into darkness , and various problems occurred .
** amaterasu omikami—who had decided that she would have one of her sons , amenooshihomimi , descend to ashihara no nakatsukuni—dispatched amatsu kami ( the god of heaven ) there .
by the time amenooshihomimi was ready to descend to ashihara no nakatsukuni , where peace and order had been established , ninigi—the grandchild of amaterasu omikami—was born and ordered to go down there by amaterasu omikami .
** interpretations
** others have viewed her as a deified miko ( female shinto attendant ) .
her alias name , " hirume , " literally means " the woman of the sun , " as a miko , an attendant of the sun god .
according to a theory , a miko who had served the god of the sun came to be regarded as identical to the god himself ; this caused the god to be thought of as female , although the god of the sun is typically male .
other theories consider that amaterasu omikami is female because her myth was established during the era of empress jito , or because himiko was her model .
** in comparative mythology , the myth of the birth of amaterasu omikami is nearly identical to that of pangu , as recorded earlier ( somewhere during the third or fourth century ) .
because the story of turning the eyes into the sun and the moon is a common analogy found across asia , some consider that the myth was propagated as peoples migrated around the region during prehistory .
** some scholars point out that in " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , the divinity of amaterasu omikami , was changed in three stages .
the following describes the historical events and their details that triggered the changes :
** 000 : the taika era reforms took place .
it was after these reforms that the imperial family began to worship amaterasu omikami .
** hi no kami ( the god of the sun ) or the sun itself .
a male god called " amateru " was widely worshipped .
in fact , amateru ( as the name of the male god ) is the alias name of amaterasu omikami ' s grandson amenohoakari , who is the first ancestor of the owari , tsumori and kaifu clans .
additionally , amenohoakari ' s younger brother was ninigi , the great-grandfather of emperor jimmu .
** 000 : the jinsin war broke out .
** " ohirumenomuchi ( a woman who worships the god of the sun ) " or " tanabatatsume . "
two interpretations exist : first , to consider that the god worshipped was ohirumenomuchi ( a female god ) , and secondly , to think that the god honored was amateru , the male god in the form of a snake .
** 000 : kodai jingu was elected .
** " amateras , " or the ancestor god of the imperial family
a female god .
using empress jito as a model , amaterasu omikami was changed from the god of nature into a humanized god .
since then , the " amaterasu " portion of amaterasu omikami , if not meant to be the kososhin ( the ancestor of the imperial family ) , has been pronounced " amateru . "
** from 0000 to 0000 , a fierce debate took place over the shinto doctrine concerning which gods should be enshrined in the temple of shinto jimukyoku ( office ) in hibiya , tokyo .
this debate was eventually brought to an end by the decision of emperor meiji , resulting in the defeat of the izumo group , and amaterasu omikami was ranked at the highest level of all the gods .
the government is said to have learned from this debate that it was impossible to establish a common shinto doctrine and to rule the people of the modern state directly through its restoration .
for more information , see " debate regarding the gods to be enshrined , " by shinto jimukyoku , kokka shinto ( state shinto ) .
** in depicting amaterasu omikami in his novel , ryunosuke akutagawa used the alias " ohirumemuchi . "
in fact , akutagawa had to make many revisions , additions and deletions to his novels due to the inspection conducted by the army .
** masahiro yasuoka ( 0000-0000 ) , the founder of kinkei gakuin ( 0000 ) , said that the japanese people worshipped amaterasu omikami .
amaterasu omikami represents the ideal of the japanese spirit to cover the world with the rays of the sun .
the " izana " of " izanami " and " izanagi , " which means " to lead , " also represents an ideal of the japanese people who set an example for other peoples in the world as leaders , forerunners and originators .
** shrines that honor amaterasu omikami
shrines that worship amaterasu omikami are called shinmei shrines and are scattered across the country , but their chief shrine is the naiku ( inner shrine ) of ise jingu shrine .
kotai jingu is a shrine that houses yataka no kagami ( mirror of yataka ) , one of the sanshu no jingi ( three kinds of treasures ) , as the object of worship .
nearly all the shrines in japan distribute the shinsatsu ( talisman ) ( jingu taima ( shrine amulet ) ) of kotai jingu shrine ( tensyo kotai jingu shrine ) .

** what does tsukuyomi mean ?
** poems in manyoshu about tsukuyomi
** books and mangas depicting tsukuyomi
** tsukuyomi ( cited as " 月讀 " ( tsukuyomi ) or tsukuyomi no mikoto ) is one of the gods of japanese mythology .
according to " kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) " and " nihon shoki ( chronicles of japan ) , " tsukuyomi was born from izanagi .
generally , tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon who rules the night , but some oppose this view ( as discussed later ) .
tsukuyomi is also referred to as tsukiyomi .
** although tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon , his ( or her ) divinity varies from one literary source to the next .
** tsukuyomi was born in a pair with amaterasu , the god of the sun , and this idea is , in comparison mythology , common across various myths .
( note that apollo was initially a different god than helios , the god of the sun ; eventually they came to be regarded as identical . )
the birth of amaterasu and tsukuyomi is in keeping with a story common throughout the world : that the sun and moon were created as a pair .
** although in japanese mythology tsukuyomi is considered equally as important as amaterasu and susanoo , he ( or she ) appears in " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " much less often and is generally less active .
the story of tsukuyomi is told only in document 0 of section 00 of chapter 0 of " nihon shoki , " where the origin of whole grain is described .
some say this is an effort to strike a balance by placing a quiet , inactive god between two gods of contrasting characteristics : amaterasu and susanoo .
similar structures are seen with ameno minakanushi no kami against takamimusubi and with kamimusubi , and hosesuri against hoori ( yamasachihiko ) and hoderi ( umisachihiko ) .
this is referred to as the " hollow structure " of japanese mythology .
some consider that tsukuyomi and susanoo are identical , because their ruling areas and episodes are somewhat the same .
** in the first part of " kojiki , " tsukuyomi was born from izanagi no mikoto as she rinsed her right eye and , together with her other children amaterasu and susanoo , is called mihashira no tattokiko ( the three noble children ) .
although tsukuyomi no mikoto was instructed to rule the country of the night , none of his subsequent activities is stated .
some say that tsukuyomi was ordered to rule yomi ( the world after death ) where izanami no kami had lived .
** in trying to entertain tsukiomi by offering him ( or her ) food and sake , ukemochi no kami is said to have vomited rice from her mouth , which disgusted her guest and caused him ( or her ) to slaughter her with a sword .
cows , horses , silkworms and rice plants were born from her body , and this is said to be the origin of cereal grain .
according to the myth , amaterasu omikami became angry , knowing the cruel deed of tsukiyomi and condemning him ( or her ) as a bad god ; from that day on , the sun and moon have come to live one night apart from each other .
this is the myth about the separation of the sun and moon , consequently giving rise to day and night .
** however , in " kojiki " susanoo murdered the god of food ( oogetsuhime ) in the same manner ( see the origin of foods in japanese myths ) .
some say this is because a myth about either one of the gods was later cited as an episode of the other .
** tsukuyomi makes his ( or her ) appearance again in the era when human emperors started to rule this country on behalf of the gods .
** in the chapter " shimane no kori " of " izumo no kuni fudoki ( fudoki of izumo province ) , " tsukutsumi no mikoto-who is considered to be a son ( or daughter ) of izanagi no mikoto-made his ( or her ) appearance .
** the distance between the umaya ( horse station ) and the guke ( the governor ' s office ) in the chikumi district is approximately 00 ri and 000 ho .
tsukutsumi no mikoto , the son ( or daughter ) of izanagi no mikoto , sat here .
although he ( or she ) should have been called tsukutsumi , people today still call him ( or her ) simply chikumi .
** tsukutsumi ' is thought to be the spirit of the moon like wadatsumi ( the god of the ocean ) and yamatsumi ( the god of the mountain ) .
** presumably because of an ancient chinese legend that associates the moon with the japanese judas tree , tsukuyomi no mikoto is said to have stood at the foot of the tree .
additionally , in manyoshu ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) there are poems that connect tsukihito ( moon person ) and the japanese judas tree .
** other examples of metaphors of the moon in " manyoshu " include expressions such as ' tsukihito ( moon person ) ' and ' sasarae otoko ( little beautiful boy ) . '
** this shrine appears to worship a female god of the moon .
although this god does not appear in " kojiki , " " nihon shoki " or " manyoshu , " this shrine is cited as ' mezuki no yashiro ' in the ' ogun ' chapter of " izumo no kuni fudoki ( fudoki of izumo province ) . "
** in " manyoshu , " the moon is referred to as ' 月讀壮士 ( tsukuyomi otoko ) , ' ' 月人壮士 ( tsukihito otoko ) ' and ' 月夜見 ( tsukiyomi ) . '
in " izumo no kuni fudoki , " a god called ' 都久豆美命 ( tsukutsumi = 月津見？ ( tsukitumi ) ' makes his ( her ) appearance .
in " yamashiro no kuni fudoki ( fudoki of yamashiro province ) , " tsukuyomi is cited as ' 月讀尊 ( tsukiyomi no mikoto ) ' although the text is incomplete .
** " engishiki ( list of official shrines ) , " which was completed at a slightly later time , lists the god worshipped at ise jingu shrine as ' 月讀 ( tsukuyomi ) ' and ' 月夜見 ( tsukiyomi ) . '
** additionally , the following is a list of how ' tsukuyomi ' was spelled in the " jodai " special kana orthography ( the special kana orthography of the era of nara or earlier ) .
** kojiki
読 ( " yomi " ) of 月読 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ乙 ( ' yo ' ) ・ミ甲 ( ' mi ' )
** nihon shoki
読 ( " yomi " ) of 月読 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ乙 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( " mi " )
弓 ( " yumi " ) of 月弓 ( " tsuki yumi " ) : spelled ユ- ( " yu " ) ・ ミ甲 ( " mi " )
夜見 ( " yomi " ) of 月夜見 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ甲 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( " mi " )
** manyoshu
読 ( " yomi " ) of 月読 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ乙 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( " mi " )
夜見 ( " yomi " ) of 月夜見 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ甲 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( ' mi ' )
余美 ( " yomi " ) of 月余美 ( " tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ乙 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( ' mi ' )
** the following is a list of the kana orthography that focuses on ヨ ( " yo " ) and ユ ( " yu " ) :
ヨ乙 : used in 月読 ( ' tsukuyomi ' ) and " 月余美 " ( ' tsukiyomi ' )
ヨ甲 : used in 月夜見 ( " tsukiyomi " )
ユ : used in 月弓 ( " tsukiyumi " )
** the name of the god ( tsukuyomi ) allows for several theories about where it comes from .
** the most popular theory is to connect the name to the calendar , as tsukuyomi is about reading ( " yomi " ) the moon ( ' tsuki " ) .
just as " koyomi ( calendar ) , " for example , means reading ( " yomi " ) dates ( " ka " ) , tsukuyomi means reading ( " yomi " ) the moon ( " tsuki " ) .
that is why tsukuyomi , who counts days and months , is considered to be the measurer and ruler of time and the calendar .
** on the other hand , ' 月弓 ' ( the moon and bow ) -which is how tsukuyomi is cited in " nihon shoki " -indicates that people associated the crescent moon with a bow , being a weapon .
** the inconsistency regarding the domain of tsukuyomi between stories indicates that his ( or her ) divinity has been created by interweaving different ideas and is therefore prone to variation .
** chapter 0 ( 000 ) : in the rays of the moon , why don ' t you come and see me , as we are not so far apart with no mountain separating us ?
chapter 0 ( 000 ) : although i ' m bathed in clear moonlight , i ' m confused and bewildered .
chapter 0 ( 000 ) dear tsukuyomi otoko , the god of the moon sitting in the heavens , i would give you a present if you could make tonight into five hundred nights .
chapter 0 ( 0000 ) : the moon might be traveling a long way over the ocean ; i wonder in the dim moonlight as evening draws on .
chapter 0 ( 0000 ) : although you , tsukuyomi otoko , are traveling over the sky and i can see you every night , you are not the one i can depend on .
chapter 00 ( 0000 ) : with a long bridge or a high mountain that would take me to the heavens , i could get the water of tsukuyomi and give it to my master to make him young again .
chapter 00 ( 0000 ) : in the pure moonlight , i went through isoumi no ura beach and left the port in a boat .
chapter 00 ( 0000 ) : in the pure moonlight when the wind died down in the evening , i called a sailor and had him row a boat in the creek .
** shrines that worship tsukuyomi
** there are two types of shrines that worship tsukuyomi .
one is to worship tsukuyomi , the younger brother of amaterasu omikami , and a great example of it is tsukiyominomiya , an annex to kotai jingu shrine .
tsukiyomi no miya is situated in toyouke daijingu betsugu , the annex to toyouke daijingu shrine .
** the other group of shrines consists of those that initially worshiped a god of the moon that had no bearing to tsukuyomi but later converged on tsukuyomi , as it appears in myths .
a great example of this is gassan jinja shrine ( shonai town , higashitagawa district , yamagata prefecture ) , one of the shrines of dewa sanzan ( the three mountains of dewa ) .
most of the gassan jinja shrines across this country have been transferred from that of dewa sanzan .
additionally , tsukuyomi shrine , in iki city , is thought to have honored a god of the moon that is different from tsukuyomi and that of dewa sanzan .
however , there is an opposing theory based on kenzoki ( records of the kenzo period ) of nihon shoki , claiming that tsukuyomi shrine of iki is where tsukuyomi worship started , but no conclusion has been reached .
tsukuyomi shrine of kyoto city , which belongs to matsunoo taisha shrine ( nishikyo-ku , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture ) , has been transferred from tsukuyomi shrine of iki city .

** other miko
** 巫女 ( miko ) or 神子 ( fujo ) are women who mainly serve the gods of yamato ( japan ) .
** in ancient times , their role was to get the messages of the gods ( oracles ) and convey them to other people , but in the modern age it has changed to a role in shrines served by women .
according to kunio yanagida and taro nakayama , miko can be classified into two groups : kannagi , a group of miko who served the imperial court ; and kuchiyose , a group of miko who served the common people .
** this section limits miko to those who are historically famous , having served in shrines , ceremonies and wedding parlors .
for more information about miko , please see " miko ' s work , hobbies and subculture . "
** it is thought that women capable of this gave birth to miko .
in archaic japanese , the miko was cited as 巫 .
also , note that men who offered similar religious services were referred to as 巫 .
** in the middle age and onward , the kagura ( shinto dance and music dedicated to the gods ) came to be routinely performed by miko at major shrines throughout the country .
over time , the kagura experienced a change so that , in addition to its traditional supernatural element , it came to be performed as a rite of prayer for the earthly wishes of requestors who sought secular benefits .
associated with shugenjas ( people who practice shugendo , walking around in the mountains and valleys ) , a more local and secular type of miko emerged , who performed prayers and invocations outside the shrine .
this explains why , even today , the act of invocation or prayer is sometimes referred to as kagura or " performing kagura . "
** officially certified , azusa miko earned her living by performing kuchiyose ( invocations ) , charging 00 to 000 mon each time .
they were slaves , such as geigi ( geisha ) and shogi ( prostitutes ) , whose revenues went to their masters .
such a person would have a bizarre appearance , carrying a dark-stained box wrapped in a furoshiki on her back , and when serving a customer she would place it in front of her .
they used green leaves for calling up the spirit of a living thing ( like the customer ' s cat ) and koyori ( twist of paper ) for the soul of the dead .
she would place her arms on the box , supporting her chin , shake her rosary beads and chant spells until she descended into a state of half-sleep in order to perform the kuchiyose ( invocation ) .
the box held a clay doll in the shape of tenjin ( the god of the heavens ) , along with gohei ( long strips of paper used for shinto ceremonies ) and an azusayumi ( bow used for shinto ceremonies ) .
the modern government banned this type of business , considering it equivalent to human trafficking .
** during the meiji restoration the government thoroughly revamped the shinto shrine system and its religious services in a way that would support the restoration of the imperial regime .
in 0000 , the ministry of religious education banned all acts requesting oracles through the invocation conducted by miko outside the shrine .
this is called miko ban .
** some shrines started to hire miko as a role to support shinto priests .
this dance was performed simultaneously in all the shrines across the country at hoshuku rinjisai ( occasional festivals ) held as part of the koki celebration of november 00 , 0000 , which commemorated 0000 years of imperial reign .
training sessions held throughout the country and instructions given to ensure perfect performance on that day promulgated kaguramai ( shinto dance and music ) among shinto shrines .
** in the modern age , miko are women who work for shrines mainly through the role of routinely supporting priests and occasionally performing kagura ( shinto music ) and mai ( shinto dance ) .
they are sometimes called maihime or mikannko .
miko need neither certification nor qualification .
however , if you want to work for a shrine belonging to the association of shinto shrines as a priest , you must be certified by the association regardless of whether you are a man or a woman .
also , note that shrines are allowed to recruit miko by specifying " female only , " since the equal employment opportunity law does not apply to the profession .
** because no qualification or certification is required for miko , basically any woman can serve as a miko as long as she is mentally and physically healthy .
as some professional miko are recruited through newspapers , classified ads or hello work ( job-placement office ) , these may be practical means by which to land a job if you lack connections to people in shrines .
beside priests , some miko , although few in number , are recruited through educational institutions such as colleges and training schools .
** women who obtain the jobs do not serve as professional miko for a long time , because most of them retire in their late twenties , having started to work upon the end of compulsory schooling ( or more practically , after graduating from high school ) .
if one starts serving as miko after graduating from college or university , she can do so for only a few years .
** also , note that some miko capable of performing kagura ( shinto dance and music ) and teaching other miko continue to work even after they marry due to the need to pass on their knowledge and expertise to the younger generations .
** many shrines , regardless of their size , temporarily hire part-time miko during busy periods , such as the new year holidays .
shrines that hire part-time miko refer to them as " helpers . "
part-time miko are recruited directly by shrines or through colleges or high schools .
some female students studying at schools for priests temporarily work for shrines as trainees or apprentice miko .
some shrines distinguish part-time miko from professional ones by requiring them , for example , to either wear or not wear chihaya ( half-coats ) .
** they are mostly the young girls of ujikos ( local residents that worship the god of the shrine ) .
young female miko sometimes join the proceeding of chigo ( young boys ) at shinto feasts .
when dedicating kagura to the gods , miko often wear makeup , and for this special occasion it is applied heavily .
** today , a miko typically wears a white kosode ( short-sleeved kimono ) and a scarlet hakama .
these days , scarlet hakama without machi dividers are generally worn by miko , but some shrines have adopted the traditional type having a machi .
however , a hakama without a machi might be inconvenient for the miko who must move her legs in time to the music when performing kagura .
additionally , some shrines have adopted koki-colored ( red purple ) hakama for young ladies .
** in an official scene , such as when holding ceremonies or rituals or performing kagura , miko sometimes wear chihaya ( half-coats ) atop their costumes .
** many people may misunderstand this , but protecting virginity has not always been stressed throughout the country ' s history from ancient times to the modern day .
however , many people today assume that miko have been virgin since ancient times , judging from the value they now have .
historically , we cannot definitively state that miko have been required to be virgins .
( neither can we say that virginity has not been required at all . )
** today , it is impossible for a recruiting shrine to include a requirement for applicants to be virgin in terms of their freedom to choose their occupation and equal employment opportunity law .
** some buddhist temples hire young ladies who look exactly or nearly like miko , and in such cases they wear a white kimono and a scarlet hakama .

** " the chokusai-sha shrine " is a shrine where festivals are attended by imperial messengers sent by the emperor ( called chokusai ) .
however , ise jingu shrine ' s godai-matsuri festival ( except for the tsukinami-sai festival ) is treated separately , and , therefore , it is not called a chokusai-sha shrine , even though imperial messengers are sent every year .
** chokusai-sha shrines existed from long ago , and most notable were the nijuni-sha shrines in the kyoto area .
** modern chokusai-sha shrines were introduced in 0000 , when emperor meiji held a festival in hikawa-jinja shrine as chokusai .
the beginning of chokusai-sha shrines was in 0000 , when the kamo-matsuri festival and the iwashimizu-matsuri festival at kamo-jinja shrine ( kamomioya-jinja shrine , kamowakeikazuchi-jinja shrine ) and iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine were designated as chokusai .
their numbers have increased since then , and by the end of the war ( 0000 ) , the following shrines were chokusai-sha shrines .
( shrine names and name of their locations today .
** currently , there are sixteen chokusai-sha shrines , excluding the chosen-jingu shrine , which closed when the war ended .
among these , imperial messengers are sent every ten years to usa-jingu shrine and kashii-gu shrine , every six years to kashima-jingu shrine and katori-jingu shrine , and to the grand festival in spring and autumn at the yasukuni-jinja shrine .

** popular beliefs concerning torii
** a measure against the unlawful dumping of garbage
** there are several theories about the origin of torii , but none of them is clear .
in any event , by the eighth century they had obtained the shape we now recognize .
** likewise , the origin of the word remains uncertain .
there are several theories : the word may have originated from ' 鶏居 ' ( bird perch ) , from " toori-iru ( pass through and enter ) " or from the way it had been pronounced ( " torana " ) , to which chinese characters were applied .
** torii are counted as i-ki ( one ki of torii ) and ni-ki ( two ki of torii ) .
when there is more than one torii in the approach , we call the first of the torii " ichi no torii ' and the second of the torii " ni no torii , " starting with the one farthest from the shrine .
** the torii ' s basic structure has two columns topped with horizontal rails respectively called the kasagi and shimagi , and below the top two rails is another horizontal rail called the nuki , which connects the two columns .
** torii are generally classified into two styles--the shinmei style and myojin style--from which various derivatives have been developed .
** a shinmei-style torii , when considered as a whole , has a fundamentally linear design .
boards are used for the kasagi and nuki .
this type of torii does not have the shimagi below the kasagi ; instead , its columns consist of unsquared logs , which are vertically erected .

** it is commonly believed that if one can throw a stone onto the top of the torii , one ' s wish will be granted .
** nowadays , we see torii as small as 00 to 00 centimeters high placed in residential or vacant areas .
the simplest torii is the one made of a thin board that is cut in the shape of a torii and attached to a concrete or block fence , which might also have one drawn on it in red paint .
because it was started when illegal dumping was not a problem , this may have originated in an attempt to prevent people from urinating outside by drawing the shape of a torii in red paint at the bottom of a fence .
in any event , this story most simply and adequately reveals the relationship between religion and morality .
** komainu
** origin of its name
** komainu in shrines and temples
** komainu as a couple
** imaginary beasts other than komainu
** a komainu ( " 石獅子 " in chinese and " imperial guardian lion " in english ) is an imaginary mythical beast that resembles a dog and lion mixed together .
komainu are placed in pairs , one of each on either side of the entrance to a shrine or temple or the façade of its main hall .
strictly speaking , these should be referred to as " shishi komainu " ( literally , " lion dogs " ) .
** according to some scholars , its name suggests that komainu is a dog from koma ( goryeo ) .
this is because they are considered to have come through korea .
but the leading theory is that komainu has an indian origin .
this leads us to conclude that the shishi is not a lion , but a mythical divine beast named " shishi " .
** typically , the statue on your right is an agyo , which has no horns and has its mouth open .
the statue on your left is ungyo , which has one horn , with its mouth closed .
the komainu statues , created from the showa era onwards , do not have a horn no matter on which side they are placed .
these should be primarily called " shishi " .
** although komainu seen on the grounds of temples or shrines are often made of stone or bronze , some placed inside the main shrine are made of wood .
** this also suggests that emonfu of the right placed the statue on the right side of the gate ; all of these signify that the komainu dates back to the heian era .
among the shishi/komainu statues of that time , the ones in the chinju hachimangu shrine of the yakushi-ji temple in nara are well-known ; they are made of wood and have been designated important cultural assets .
however , as neither of the statues have a horn , they should be more appropriately called " shishi pair " .
other komainu statues that have been designated important cultural assets include those of the daiho jinja shrine in shiga , the kozan-ji temple in kyoto , and the itsukushima jinja shrine in hiroshima .
** although similar statues are found in china and korea , those that come in a pair of a-un ( agyo and ungyo ) are typically seen in japan .
this may be because they were under the influence of kongo rikishi ( a guardian deity of buddhism ) and the a-un style had already become the norm by the end of the heian era .
however , from modern to the present age in japan , the vast number of komainu have been made in various forms and shapes .
for example , the statues of other animals like boars , dragons , or foxes , play a similar role as well .
in shinto , all of these animals are called shinshi ( the messengers of the god ) .
many shrines ( or enshrined gods ) have adopted specific animals as their shinshi .
most notable are foxes in the inari-jinja shrine , deer in the kasuga-jinja shrine , and snakes in benzaiten .
some are based on local lore .
for example , at the joken-ji temple in tono , the statues of kappa ( a legendary creature , assumed to carry a dish filled with water on its head ) are standing where komainu are supposed to be , following the local legend of the kappa .
** they are typically placed with their backs against the temples or shrines that they are supposed to protect .
in some exceptions , however , some are placed facing towards the temples or shrines .
some do not come in pairs although they are few in number .
** some temples or shrines consider komainu on your right and your left as a couple .
as long as komainu are in the shape of shishi ( liondog ) , the one that has mane is no doubt male .
some insist that the above view is wrong as it is biologicallyimpossible for two komainu to make a couple .
on the other hand , some support the view that they are a couple as some breast-feed or pacify their komainu or shishi puppies .
there is no use arguing over which is right , but the fact is that there are two theories ; one is to support the view that a pair of komainu is a couple and the other is to oppose to it .

** ommyodo
** history
** the chinese characters for ommyodo can be read " inyodo " as well .
people who practise ommyodo are called ommyo-ji ( diviners or sorcerers ) and a group of ommyo-ji is again called ommyodo .
** at one time , researchers thought that the philosophy of the yin and yang introduced into japan developed into ommyodo .
** the ritsuryo system , while prohibiting priests from practicing divination and observing the movements of the sun , moon , and planets , provided opportunities for ommyo-ji to exclusively conduct state affairs .
** ommyodo spread from the palace into japanese society while becoming more generalized ; thanks to the efforts by bonze ommyo-ji , priests who practiced ommyodo , it permeated deeply into the populace and developed more uniquely in japan .
** from the end of the heian period onwards , the abe clan produced the masters of ommyodo , one after another , helping the clan , who had been low-ranking nobles , get promoted to the level of court nobles .
on the other hand , during the muromachi period , ommyodo permeated more deeply among common people , causing private ommyo-ji to flourish as fortune-tellers and shamans .
** over time , the tsuchimikado family outstripped the koutokui family , and by the end of the 00th century , they achieved a dominant position in ommyodo across japan by obtaining the right to grant ommyo-ji licenses .
although ommyodo had lost its political clout by the beginning of the edo period , it became widespread and permeated deeply into japanese society as folk beliefs ; that people used to seek for an auspicious date or direction for special occasions .
** in 0000 after meiji restoration , the meiji government abolished ommyodo as superstition .
** kogo shui
** kogo shui is a piece of writing about shinto during the heian period .
hironari inbe , a government official , compiled this book in 000 .
this is a one-volume book .
** how this book came into existence
this book is said to have been written on february 00 , 000 .
some copies say that it was written in 000 .
however , the postface reads ; " just now , the emperor ' s luck turned for the better for the first time…… . in the first year of the new era . "
this reveals that the book was written at least later than may 00 , 000 , when the era changed from the 00th year of the enryaku era to the first year of daido , suggesting that the book being written in the first year of daido is wrong .
** those who support the view that the book was written in the first year of daido ( 000 ) , considered that " kogo shui " was evidence of this , based upon when the ruling was made .
but , this view goes against the fact that kogo shui was written based upon a ruling of august 00 .
** author
additionally , his promotion is thought to be due to his excellent services at daijo-sai ( the first ceremonial offering of rice by a newly-enthroned emperor ) .
** according to the postface of this book , however , he was ranked jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) , but in 000 ( when he wrote the book ) , he should have been ranked shorokuinojo ( senior sixth rank , upper grade ) .
the postface must have been altered at a later time .
** objective
to complain about the state of his clan and to file a petition
the inbe was a clan who had traditionally administered religious rituals and services at the imperial court .
this book is thought to have been written to ensure that the inbe clan was favorably positioned in the imperial court by claiming that it was a legitimate clan for conducting religious services .
** to submit a report to the imperial court
the view had been long supported that this book was written for the purpose of complaining about the state the inbe clan had been in and filing a petition about it .
nowadays , the popular view is that this book was a report submitted by the inbe clan to the imperial court , that had been conducting investigation to put a legal system in place .
** there was a long time dispute between the inbe and nakatomi clans over which would take the post of hoheishi ( imperial messenger to a shrine and envoy returning courtesies ) at the grand shrine of ise .
on august 00 , 000 , a ruling was made in favor of the inbe clan .
it was after the ruling that this book was submitted to the imperial court on february 00 , 000 .
it would be strange for the inbe clan to file a petition after they won the suit , making the view that the book was written for the purpose of complaining and filing a petition less convincing .
** emperor heijo , at that time , had a plan to establish the shiki ( enforcement regulations ( of the ritsuryo ) ) .
it would be safe to conclude that this book was a report submitted to the imperial court , that had been conducting investigations to establish enforcement regulations .
** it was during this period that " enryaku gishiki cho " ( a list of shrines ) was also submitted by the ise jingu shrine ( grand shrine at ise ) .
this is also considered to have been part of a preliminary investigation by the imperial court to establish shiki and of a series of events that included " kogo shui " as well .

** this records the events that occurred during the period from the creation of heaven and earth to the tempyo era ( 000-000 ) .
** the inbe clan is considered to be the descendants of ame no futodama , a god who served amaterasu omikami .
that ' s why this book contains more success stories of soshin ( enshrined ancestors ) of the inbe clan such as ame no futotama than the kojiki and nihonshoki .
for example , when amaterasu omikami hid herself in amano iwa to ( literally , " the rock cave of heaven " ) , ame no futotama no mikoto played a central role .
** impact
this book was cited and used in literature including the sendai kuji hongi , honcho gatsuryo , seiji yoryaku , chokan-kanmon , nenju gyoji hisho , syakunihongi , and the books of ise shinto .
this reveals that this book has been valued as a book of shinto gods .
** research
in 0000 , katsutaka nasa wrote a book titled " gisai " .
in it , he criticized " koji shui " as just depicting the inbe clan who had been complaining about their state and filing a petition .
norinaga motoori , who opposed to this view , wrote a book titled " gisaiben " to defend it .
** so far , this book has been regarded as being of less importance , when compared to the kojiki and the nihonsyoki .
it is now being re-evaluated .
** goryo shinko
** what is a spirit ?
it is common for people around the world to believe that once a man dies , his soul leaves his body .
even in japan , we ' ve had a similar belief since primitive times , as shown in the crouched burial position of the jomon period .
so , it is safe to conclude that the people then believed that departed spirits or souls could bring various misfortunes to the living .
in ancient times there was a rise in the belief that departed souls of those deposed politically or defeated in war would bring calamity upon their opponents or enemies , giving birth to goryo shinko during the heian period .
** before looking into goryo shinko itself , we should know more about what people from ancient times , the middle ages , and the present thought about the spirit .
generally speaking , they commonly believed in spirit as emperor kammu , fujiwara no michinaga , and takauji ashikaga feared apparition .
in the nara period , divination , which dealt with the spirits of people who were alive , became popular not only among the imperial family and court nobles but also among common people .
so , a belief in onryo ( restless souls ) or goryo ( honorable spirits ) , which we are going to discuss , should not be regarded as unique .
** from onryo to goryo
experiencing rampant political battles and wars throughout the ancient period , people must have developed a firm belief in onryo .
onryo are the departed spirits of people who died with a grudge or died unnaturally like those deposed or defeated in wars .
onryo will bring misfortune not only to political opponents and enemies , but also to society in general ( often in the form of an epidemic ) .
a chronological list of people who were believed to have become onryo includes fujiwara no hirotsugu , princess inoe , prince osabe , and prince sawara .
this is goryo shinko .
to repose departed souls , rituals called " goryoe " were held in the imperial court .
according to nihon sandai jitsuroku ( the sixth of the six classical japanese history texts ) , the first identifiable goryoe ritual was held at shinsen-en temple on may 00 , 000 .
** typical gods deified in goryo shinko are enshrined in kami shimo goryojinja shrine in kyoto .
** although goryo shinko prevailed since the heian period , there is no consensus on how far back we could go to identify when it in fact started .
takeshi umehara ' s theory that prince shotoku was an onryo , as discussed in his book , " kakusareta jujika " ( " hidden crucifix " ) , is not backed by much credible evidence .
his theory about prince nagaya might be true because he and fujiwara no hirotsugu lived almost during the same period .
it would be safe to conclude that it ' s difficult to obtain evidence for onryo from the nara period or earlier .
** at least , jien says that onryo will not appear without a reason ; they will take their revenge .
** this view may have been derived and developed from hogen monogatari and tale of the heike , which believe that the turmoil in the society like gempei kassen ( battles between the heishi clan and minamoto clan ) were caused by the onryo of sutokuin .
** gongoro kamakura , who was a one-eyed warrior , should also be examined in terms of ethnology ( under the category of ' one-eyed goblin ' ) .
** gion shinko
we have ' ekijin shinko ' , which is close to goryo shinko .
this is similar to goryo shinko in that it deifies the angel of death like the hoso kami ( the god of smallpox and the god of flu ) to prevent such diseases .
one that is nationally well-known is gion shinko , which deifies gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) .
gozu tenno , which had been believed to bring diseases and misfortunes to people , was enshrined in yasaka-jinja shrine in kyoto , giving birth to gion shinko .
many shrines that bear the names ; " yasaka-jinja shrine , " " gion-jinja shrine , " and " yagumo-jinja shrine , " had once enshrined gozu tenno ( they often have aliases that contain the sound of " tenno " at the end . )
due to the meiji government ' s policy on religion , however , some shrines enshrined susanohno mikoto .
** gion-matsuri festival , which is still held in the present day , is derived from the worship of gozu tenno .
** other
** the term " goro-zuka , " burial sites seen across the country where gorinto ( five-stored towers ) are erected or where stones are piled up , may have been previously pronounced " goryo-zuka " .
this is also part of goryo shinko .
** in the middle ages , the emperor was in the habit of katachigae ( a practice of approaching a destination in a different direction than going directly from one ' s house ) for fear of onryo every time he passed through the neighborhood of mikoshi-gosyo in gion .
this is called " gion katatagae , " " goryoe onkatatagae gyoko , " or " katatagae gyoko , " and there was no one right way to say it .
some say , however , that katatagae was simply a way to avoid streets that were too crowded .
** shinsen ( food and alcohol offering to the gods )
** special shinsen
** shinsen is an offering to shrines and household shinto altars in japan .
it is also called mike or minie .
** shinsen includes the cooked type called jukusen and the raw type called seisen .
to cook the jukusen , in principle , only flames ( secret fire ( imibi ) ) produced by firestones or maigiri-shiki ( style using gimlets ( maigiri ) , ancient tools for making fire ) is used .
** in shrines , offerings include rice , salt , water , vegetables , bonitos , dried bonito , seaweed , fruits , and seishu or refined sake .
although shinsen is usually offered in a unglazed vessel called kawarake ( earthenware cup ) , an abalone shell may be used in some regions .
** it is , in principle , served twice a day--morning and evening--but how often it is served a day may vary from region to region .
** naorai refers to shinsen eaten in a feast after a ceremony .
eating the naorai not only means getting closer to a god by eating what has been offered , but also proves that things unfit to eat have not been offered .
** strictly speaking , however , the shinsen offered on the altars is not necessarily served as a naorai .
in some regions , the shinsen offered on the altars is thrown in shintaizan ( a mountain where the spirit of deity is traditionally believed to dwell ) or buried underground even today .
this indicates that there were different courtesies or stances toward shinsen , which have been passed down to the present day .
** the shinsen offered in many shrines is seisen ( raw type ) today but quite a rare style of shinsen has been offered in some well known and old shrines or other shrines that have carried on traditional shinto rituals .
such a rare shinsen is called special shinsen , for convenience , and jukusen , a cooked type , is mainly offered . .
( because standard shinsen is considered to be what is defined in the rules for ritual procedures at shrines , the traditional shinsen has been seen as " special , " and called so .
this is greatly influenced by the reform of the rules for ritual procedures at shrines as well as the change in meaning of shrines and shinto after meiji restoration .
** examples of special shinsen are :
** " osome goku " in the kasuga wakamiya onmatsuri festival of kasuga-taisha shrine , nara city , nara prefecture
" mitobiraki yakusa no shinsen " and " mitana shinsen " in kasuga matsuri festival of kasuga-taisha shrine , nara city , nara prefecture
" isagawa matsuri shinsen " in isagawa matsuri festival of isagawa-jinja shrine , nara city , nara prefecture
" hyakumi onjiki " in kakissai festival of tanzan-jinja shrine , tonomine , sakurai city , nara prefecture
" naijin shinsen , " " gaijin shinsen , " and " niwazumi shinsen " in aoi-matsuri festival of kamomioya-jinja shrine/kamowake-ikazuchi-jinja shrine , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture
" yuki omike " of ise-jingu shrine , ise city , mie prefecture
" awazu no goku " in sanno matsuri festival of hiyoshi-taisha shrine , otsu city , shiga prefecture
" aofushigaki shinji shinsen " in aofushigaki shinji of miho-jinja shrine , matsue city , shimane prefecture
" ogozen " in toro shinji of iyahiko-jinja shrine , yahiko-mura , nigata prefecture
" ontosai shinsen " in ontosai festival of suwa-taisha shrine , suwa city , nagano prefecture
" daikyosai shinsen " in daikyosai festival of katori-jingu shrine , katori city , chiba prefecture
some small shrines in the kinki region have been handed down and carried on traditional shinto rituals and services in which special shinsen is offered on the altar .
the special shinsen in those shrines are often the subject of research into the studies of shinto , folklore , and food culture .
various factors such as the regional industry , financing of shrines , the way of practicing faith , and purposes of shinto services and rituals can be glimpsed at in each special shinsen .
special shinsen can be regarded as a remarkable religious phenomenon as a food culture developed by the japanese .
** ukanomitama
** ukanomitama is a deity that appears in japanese mythology ( shinto religion ) .
kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) describes it as " ukanomitama no kami " and nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) as " uganomitama no mikoto . "
** in kojiki , the pedigree record of susanoo ( deity in japanese mythology ) defines it as a child who was born between susanoo and kamu-oichi-hime ( the daughter of oyamatsumi ) and a brother of otoshi no kami .
** uka ' in its name means grain and food , showing that it is a deity of harvest .
it is the shusaijin ( main enshrined deities ) of fushimi inari-taisha shrine in kyoto and widely worshiped as an inari-shin ( oinari-san - god of harvests , wealth , fertility , etc . )
it is also known as miketsu kami .
some are confused to regard it as a fox because the fox was once called " ketsu , " but it is a messenger of the deity that assumes the shape of a fox .
** kojiki and nihonshoki only mention its name without describing what it did .
the books do not describe its sex , so it is not clear whether it is a god or goddess
fushimi inari-taisha shrine , which is the grand head shrine of inari-jinja shrine , regards it as a goddess .
** it is also worshiped as a deity of harvest as well as a deity of agriculture or a deity of commerce and industry .
it is enshrined in inari-jinja shrines across the country such as fushimi inari-taisha shrine ( kyoto city ) , kasama inari-jinja shrine ( kasama city , ibaraki prefecture ) , yutoku inari-jinja shrine ( saga prefecture ) .

** oyamakuhi no kami
** oyamakuhi no kami is a japanese deity .
the god is also called yamasue no onushi no kami .
** he is the son of otoshi no kami and amenochikarumizu hime .
** the ' kuhi ' of his name means pile , ( heavy beam of timber ) indicating that he is a deity who drives a pile of heavy timber into oyama ( " big mountain " ) , and the mountain ' s owner .
according to the kojiki ( records of ancient matters - japan ' s oldest historical record ) , the deity is enshrined in hieno-yama ( later called and mt . hiei ) and matsuo , kazuno district , and narikabura is where the deity resides .
** since enryaku-ji buddhist temple of the tendai sect was built on mt . hiei , the deity also came to be regarded as the guardian deity of the tendai sect and enryaku-ji temple .
the god is also called " sanno , " the king of mt . hiei .
a shinto school derived from the tendai sect was called " sanno shinto , " later changed to " sanno ichijitsu shinto " by tenkai ( a priest of the tendai sect , who lived in the early edo period ) .
dokan ota built hie-jinja shrine by moving oyamakuhi no kami from kawagoe-hiyoshi-sha shrine to make it the guardian deity of edo-jo castle .
during the edo period , the deity was regarded as that of the tokugawa family , and since the meiji period , it has been regarded as the guardian deity of the imperial palace .
** hiyoshi-taisha shrine at the foot of mt . hiei is the headquarters of all the hie-jinja shrines that worship oyamakuhi no kami across the country .
later , omononushi ( a deity in japanese mythology ) was enshrined in hie-jinja shrines ; omononushi is called " obie " ( " big hie " ) and oyamakuhi no kami " kobie " ( " small hie " ) .
" sanno " is the general term for these two deities .
omononushi is enshrined in nishihongu ( " west main shrine " ) and oyamakuhi no kami in higashihongu ( " east main shrine " ) .
** besides , the two deities are enshrined in higashihongu ( chiyoda ward , tokyo prefecture ) , and also in matsuo-taisha shrine ( nishikyo ward , kyoto city ) .
** the god inari
** the god inari is one of the japanese shinto gods .
the god is also called " daimyojin " and is well-known as " oinari-sama " and " oinari-san . "
shrines that worship the god inari are called inari-jinja shrines .
fushimi inari-taisha shrine in fushimi ward , kyoto city is considered to be the headquarters of all the inari-jinja shrines across the country .
** summary
** during the edo period , there was a vogue phrase that lists things that were abundant in edo ( the old name of tokyo ) ; fires , quarrels , iseya ( the name of shops ) , inari , and dogs ' droppings .
initially , the god was the harvest and agriculture god , but now , it is worshipped as the god of all industries .
** in " nihon-shoki " ( the oldest chronicles of japan ) , fushimi inari-taisha shrine is depicted as follows ;
** soon , he started searching for the person by dispatching envoys to various places , and on the first day of uma ( the horse , the seventh sign of chinese zodiac ) of february 000 , hata no iroko ( or , irogu ) appeared seated .
** another theory suggests that during the sixteen kingdoms period ( in china ) , the imperial family and court nobles from the former qin dynasty might have fled to japan through the korean peninsula in the middle of a war .
the both theories require further verification .
** thanks to their great skills , they were given favorable treatment by the imperial court .
given the position of professionals , they thrived as a powerful clan based in the vicinity of kyoto .
in 000 , the hata clan in fukakusa ( fushimi ward , kyoto city ) enshrined the god inari by building a magnificent shrine in a flat place on the inarisan-sangamine mountain , which is located in the middle of the kyoto-bonchi basin .
** let ' s see whether the following may also suggest that the term " inari " comes from rice-plants hung like baggage to be dried .
** " 稲荷 " was once pronounced " ine-ni " or " ina-ni , " and later changed to " ina-ri . "
** how is the term " inari " related to inari shrine on inari-yama kofun ( an ancient mound tomb ) in sakitama kofun-gun ( a group of ancient mound tombs ) , and when was it built ?
** inari-style torii ( a type of shinto shrine archway ) and multiple torii that are elected along the approach also expressed a sense of gratitude and prayer for good rice harvest .
** inari-gi otoshi is a drainage ditch built around 0000 , which flows into the naka-gawa river .
the drainage ditch , which runs from otone-machi , kitasaitama-gun , saitama prefecture through kurihashi-machi , kitakatsushika-gun , flowed into the naka-gawa river on its left side on the border of arai , kurihashi-machi town and happo 0-chome , washimiya-machi town .
the term " inari " may have been associated with rice cultivation , but not the god .
** history
** the headquarters of all the inari-jinja shrines across the country is fushimi inari-taisha shrine , which is located on the west side and at the foot of mt . inari ( fushimi ward , kyoto city ) .
initially , the shrine worshipped the god of the hata clan , a powerful clan who had ruled the kyoto district , and its extant shake ( a family of shinto priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis ) is the onishi family .
the kada family , who produced azumamaro kada , who started kokugaku ( the study of japanese literature and culture ) in the later edo period , was also from shake .
kamo no mabuchi was one of his disciples , who was followed by norinaga motoori and atsutane hirata ; the four were called " the four master of kokugaku " .
** " yamashiro no kuni fudoki " ( a description of the climate and culture of yamashiro province , already lost ) contains the following story about how the inari-jinja shrine came into existence ;
the ancestor of the hata clan , irogu no hata no kimi , who was affluent and arrogant , tried to shoot an arrow , using a sticky rice cake as the target .
then , the rice cake turned into a white bird and flew away to the top of a mountain .
there , rice-plants ( " ine " ) ripened ( " nari " ) and this is how the god was given its name .
irogu no hata no kimi , who went over to the rice-plants , repented all the mistakes he had made in the past , pulled them up by their roots , and replanted them in his house to worship them .
" ine-nari " ( rice has ripened ) changed to " inari , " to which the chinese character " 稲荷 " was applied .
** when the capital was transferred to kyoto , the hata clan who had ruled the region gained political power , causing worship for the god inari to prevail .
when to-ji temple was built , the hata clan provided lumber from its own mt . inari , causing the god inari to be worshipped as the guardian deity of to-ji temple .
according to " nijunisha honen " , kukai ( a japanese monk , scholar , poet , and artist , founder of the shingon or " true word " school of buddhism ) directly asked the god inari to be his guardian deity .
that ' s why this god is more likely to be regarded as a tatari-gami ( cursing god ) .
** as the god inari is the rice god , it became associated with ukanomitama no mikoto , the food god , who later merged with other food gods .
** when the meiji government separated shinto and buddhism , many inari-jinja shrines chose to worship gods that appear in japanese mythology , like ukanomitama no mikoto , but some became buddhist temples , that worship dakiniten .
** the god inari and foxes
** ukanomitama no mikoto is also called ' miketsu no kami . '
a folk belief that the fox is an envoy of the god inari occurred during the middle ages .
later , this gave rise to a misunderstanding that the fox was the god inari himself .
kinko ( golden foxes ) and ginko ( silver foxes ) , which are a type of yoko ( foxes which have mysterious power to bewitch humans ) , are believed to be akin to dakiniten , while foxes enshrined in inari-jinja shrine are mostly white .
** in front of an inari-jinja shrine , the statue of foxes , instead of komainu ( guardian lion-dogs at a shinto shrine ) , are usually placed , that have jewels in their mouths .
** belief
at inari-jinja shrines , a hatsu-uma-sai festival is held on the first day of uma ( the horse , the seventh sign of chinese zodiac ) of february .
this is because the god enshrined in the fushimi inari-jinja shrine is believed to have descended on the first day of uma of 000 .
in tokyo , to cerebrate the festival , jiguchi-andon ( paper-enclosed lanterns ) with a jiguchi ( pun ) and a matching picture drawn on them , are hung along streets .
** the god inari can be generally divided into two groups ; one is the god that is worshipped by shrines and temples including the fushimi inari-taisha shrine , toyokawa inari temple , shinomura-hachimangu shrine , and the yutoku inari-jinja shrine .
the other is a god enshrined as the fox god , a god derived from a belief among common people .
** the three major inari in japan
some inari-jinja shrines or buddhist temples that worship the god inari use the phase that ' we are one of the three major inari in japan ' for promotional purposes .
however , what they say is different from shrine to shrine or temple to temple .
** according to historical writings like " dainihon-shi " ( history of great japan ) and inarishinko-jiten ( encyclopedia of inari belief ) , yutoku inari-jinja shrine and toyokawa inari temple are included in the three major inari , besides fushimi inari-taisha shrine , the headquarters .
other literature lists kasama inari-jinja shrine , takekoma-jinja shrine , and saijo inari temple as candidates .
however , fushimi inari-taisha shrine , the headquarters , say that the three major inari are different from area to area ; it has no intention to limit them to those they designate .
** additionally , toyokawa inari is a temple named myogon-ji temple , which worships buddhist dakiniten , who is totally different from ukanomitama no mikoto enshrined in fushimi .
** yutoku inari-jinja shrine ( kashima city , saga prefecture ) : fushimi and mogami
toyokawa inari temple ( toyokawa city , aichi prefecture ) : fushimi and yutoku
kasama inari-jinja shrine ( kasama city , ibaraki prefecture ) : fushimi and yutoku
saijo inari , myogyo-ji temple , the headquarters of saijo inari-kyo ( okayama city , okayama prefecture ) : fushimi and toyokawa
takekoma-jinja shrine ( iwanuma city , miyagi prefecture ) : fushimi and kasama
hanazura inari-jinja shrine ( saku city , nagano prefecture ) : fushimi and toyokawa
chiyobo inari-jinja shrine ( kaizu city , gifu prefecture ) : fushimi and toyokawa
hyotanyama inari-jinja shrine ( higashiosaka city , osaka prefecture ) : fushimi and toyokawa
kusado inari-jinja shrine ( fukuyama city , hiroshima prefecture ) : fushimi and toyokawa
taikodani inari-jinja shrine ( tsuwano city , shimane prefecture ) : this shrine claims to be one of the five major inari shrines ( or temples ) .
the other four include fushimi , kasama , yutoku , and takekoma .
** takahashi inari-jinja shrine ( kumamoto city , kumamoto prefecture ) : unknown
** the following inari shrines are also well-known :
** shiwa inari-jinja shrine ( shiwa city , iwate prefecture )
fukushima inari-jinja shrine ( fukushima city , fukushima prefecture )
yakyu inari-jinja shrine ( higashimatsuyama city , saitama prefecture )
tamatsukuri inari-jinja shrine ( chuo ward , osaka city )
** there are this many combinations of " the three major inari , " and a more detailed list would include " the three major inari in kanto " and " the three major inari in kyushu ; " it seems that there is no end to it .
for your information , fushimi inari is not included in the appendix as it is not under grand shrine at ise .
** toshigami
** " toshigami " ( 年神 , also written as 歳神 ) is a shinto god ( shinto ) .
** he ( or she ) is a raiho-shin ( visiting god ) visiting homes every new year ' s day .
different regions call him ( or her ) otondo-san , shogatsu-sama , eho-gami , otoshi no kami , toshidon , toshi jisan , wakadoshi-san , etc .
** toshi ' refers to the harvest of rice , and he ( or she ) is a grain god .
at the root is the death and rebirth of grain .
in ancient japan , with the development of agriculture , prayers at the beginning of the year for an abundant crop began , and developed to honor toshigami , which became the main event for new year ' s .
the new year ' s decorations used today , were originally for welcoming toshigami .
kadomatsu ( new year pine tree branch decoration ) is an object to which the toshigami is drawn , and the mirror-shaped rice cake was an offering to toshigami .
families built shelves called toshigamidana or ehodana , and placed the offering for toshigami there .
** meanwhile , in some regions , toshigami is honored as sorei , or ancestral spirits protecting the household .
it is because the god protecting agriculture and the sorei protecting the family were equated , and the deity of rice fields and harvests and the sorei were also believed to descend from the mountains ( refer to mountain god ) .
kunio yanagita considered the three gods , god protecting the year , deity of rice fields and harvests protecting agriculture , and sorei protecting the household , to be worshipped as one simple folk god , as toshigami .
** around the middle ages , ' toshigami ( 年神 or 歳神 ) ' began being referred to as ' toshitoku-jin ( 年徳神 or 歳徳神 ) . '
toku ( 徳 : virtue ) leads to toku ( 得 : profit ) and was considered good luck .
it was also adopted in direction , and the direction of toshitoku-jin was called ' eho ' ( favorable direction ) and was considered a direction that brings good luck .
in the almanac , toshitoku-jin is depicted as a female god , but the mythical otoshi no kami is a male god , and some say he appears as an old man .
originally a god of folk belief , there was variation in people ' s perception of his ( or her ) figure .
** otoshi no kami and mitoshi no kami

** ema
** " ema " is a wooden board with a picture of a horse , which is dedicated to a temple or a shrine when making a wish , or when showing gratitude for the granted wish .
** ema sold at temples and shrines for personal dedication are small with a picture of a horse , and have space in the margin or on the back to write the wish and a person ' s name .
those dedicated by a large group of people are large , and are prepared by the dedicator , sometimes with pictures drawn by artists .
it normally has a pentagon shape ( shape of a house ) , which can be traced back to the fact that , in the past , they were made with a roof attached to a piece of the board .
** history
** according to the " shoku-nihongi " ( the second in a series of chronicles about japan ) from the nara period , a sacred horse for the god to ride was dedicated .
however , horses were high-priced and could not be dedicated easily , and the temples and shrines receiving the horses had a hard time taking care of them .
therefore , those who could not dedicate a horse began substituting with statues of horses made from wood , paper , or clay , and from the heian period , it was substituted with a picture of a horse drawn on a board .
** furthermore , in the muromachi period , pictures other than horses were drawn .
for example , in inari-jinja shrine , where a fox is the messenger , some have pictures of foxes .
there are ema with the character ' め ' ( eye ) and a mirror image of ' め ' for the prevention of eye disease , and ema with the character ' 心 ' ( heart ) with a lock for the prevention of extramarital affairs .
in the azuchi-momoyama period , ema by distinguished artists were lionized and emado ( shrine building where ema were hanged ) were built to exhibit them .
** in the edo period , praying for practical benefits such as the well-being of the family or prosperity of business became widespread among common people , and it is in the edo period that people began dedicating small ema as we do today .
since the showa period , students preparing for examinations often dedicate ema to pass exams at the tenmangu shrine where sugawara no michizane is honored as tenjin ( heavenly gods ) , the god of learning .
** since around 0000 , from a private information protection law perspective , some ema come with stickers to place over the wish , address , and names written on the ema .
** shinsatsu
** shinsatsu is a gofu ( talisman ) distributed by shrines .
it is usually called ofuda .
shinsatsu also includes a mamorifuda as known as omamori ( a personal amulet ) .
** shinmyo or the shrine name , amaterasu-kotaijingu shrine , or what represents a deity is written on or infused in a paper , a wooden plate , osuna ( sacred sand ) , goshinsui ( sacred water ) , or a metal piece .
or each home sometimes puts it on a gate or pillar .
people keep it for praying for safety of the family and state of perfect health over the year .
** a typical shinsatsu is jingu taima ( or simply called oonusa or taima in the shito religion ) , which ise-jingu shrine distributes directly or through jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) .
the back side of the kumano-goo distributed by kumano sanzan ( three major shrines , kumano hongu taisha shrine , kumano hayatama taisha shrine and kumano nachi taisha shrine ) was used for kishomon ( sworn oath ) from the heian period through the early-modern times .
** mamorifuda
a mamorifuda is usually called ' omamori ' and distributed in a pouch of cotton .
originally it was developed by onmyodo ( way of yin and yang ; an occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements ) and temples and introduced into the shinto religion .
thus mamorifuda , similar to those of the shinto religion , are also distributed in temples today .
each household keeps ofuda as an omamori , whereas individuals keep or wear a mamorifuda for praying for divine favor .
** sangaku-shinko faith
** sangaku-shinko faith in japan
** " sangaku-shinko faith " is a faith worshipping mountains as being sacred .
they believed that mountainous areas had spiritual powers , and utilized the overwhelming awe of the mountains to bring discipline to their lives .
** forms
these faiths are strong in the cultures of inland mountainous regions and a mountains with a terrain almost inaccessible for humans is indispensable for it to emerge .
** additionally , there is a concept called ' sanjo takai ' ( in addition to this , there are kaijo takai , chichu takai , etc ) , which means that the spirits of the dead ( ancestral spirit ) return to the mountain .
these traditions led to shinto , and gave rise to a trend of faith towards mountains , as in the suwa taisha shrine in nagano prefecture and mt . miwa in nara prefecture .
in rural areas , because mountains are a source of water , there are beliefs that god of the mountain descends to the village and becomes the god of the rice fields in spring , and returns to the mountain in fall after the harvest .
although not written by a japanese , the words ' over the mountains , too far to travel , people say , happiness dwells ' in the poem by carl busse describing the view of japanese sangaku-shinko faith .
** this is why buddhist temples are called ' oo mountain △△ temple ' even if they are on flatlands .
** sacred mountains are also objects of faith in tibetan buddhism , but faith is often for the mountain itself , and it is often a taboo to climb such mountains .
meanwhile in japan , it should be noted that emphasis is placed on reaching the summit .
in japan , taiyo-shinko faith ( sun worshipping ) and sangaku-shinko faith as forms of animism are interconnected .
** later , mountaineering ascetics and mountain priests who were of the school of esoteric buddhism and taoism , detached themselves from this world , and went deep into the mountains and practiced asceticism to achieve enlightenment .
this later led to the birth of shugendo ( japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating shinto and buddhist concepts ) and witchcraft religion .
** while mountains were the object of faith as the divine world , it was also a place where memorial services for the spirit of ancestors , such as spiritualism by itako ( shrine maiden performing spiritualism ) evolved , as the next world where spirits of the dead gather .
additionally , it is a custom among the people to climb mountains as a sign of faith , and even today , many people climb mountains including those considered sacred grounds .
** regions where the sangaku-shinko faith exist
tibet
nepal
ladakh ( india )
habitats of the followers in general of religions descending from abraham ( mt . sinai in the old testament , decalogue )
korea , democratic people ' s republic of korea , yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in china ( china . other areas in the country where manchu people live )
** peru
** ubusunagami ( guardian deity of one ' s birthplace )
** ubusunagami is the deity that controls or protects one ' s birthplace .
it is simply called " ubusuna . "
the faith is closely related with local patriotism of japanese .
it seems that ubusunagami originally had a character different from the ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion ) or the village shrine god , but it has often been similarly recognized since early-modern times .
** the relationship between the ujigami and ujiko ( shrine parishioner ) is based on a kin group , whereas the relationship with the ubusunagami is based on the sense of faith in a territorial connection group .
therefore a stronger faith in ubusunagami can be seen in cities .
the word " ubusuna-mode " ( visiting one ' s own birth god ) became widely used and the custom of ubusuna-mode became popular on such occasions as the coming-of-age ceremony and shichi-go-san ( a day of prayer for the healthy growth of young children ) .
** ubusunagami has a relationship with ubugami , the god for a smooth delivery .
the trend all over japan today is that the old faith in ujigami has decreased , being absorbed in the newly developed ubusunagami .
hie-jinja shrine was regarded as a shine secreted to the ubusunagami of the tokugawa clan and its rites and festivals were on a grander scale than ever in edo .

** in an interview with soichi oya when he was sixty , he said he wrote two to three hundred tanka ( a thirty one-syllable japanese poem ) each day and had written five to six hundred thousand tanka by then .
** magatsuhi no kami
** " magatsuhi no kami ( or magatsui no kami ) " is a shinto god .
maga means disaster , tsu means ' of , ' and hi means divine spirit , thus magatsuhi means god of disaster .
** these gods were born from the impurity of hell , and are gods governing disasters .
according to mythology , after magatsuhi no kami was born , the two gods of naobi no kami and izunome were born to fix the disaster .
in a document in the tenth part of the same column in the nihon shoki , izanagi spurt out oayatsuhi no kami .
there is no description about this being born from impurity , but oaya has the same meaning as a major disaster ( omaga ) , and is considered to be of similar divinity as omagatsuhi no kami .
** later , it was believed that by worshipping this god , disaster can be avoided , and this god was honored as the guardian deity for warding off evil .
in this case , naobi no kami is often enshrined together with magatsuhi no kami .
** isotakeru no kami , who is the child of susanoo , and to whom onamuji escaped in the myth of okuninushi , was originally believed to be a different god , but in some cases believed to be the same god .
** additionally , atsutane hirata considers omagatsuhi no kami , yasomagatsuhi no kami , and oyabiko no kami as the same god as seoritsuhime no kami , one of the haraedo no kami gods ( the gods at the purification place ) .
** theological position in fukko ( restoration , reform ) shinto
norinaga motoori believed magatsuhi no kami is an evil god .
according to norinaga , magatsuhi no kami is the cause of absurdity in life .
in this world , people ' s weals and woes do not necessarily occur reasonably .
he claimed that it is the works of magatsuhi no kami that causes people living in good faith to not necessarily be blessed with happiness .
he says , ' magatsuhi no kami has a harsh spirit , and it is very sad , but there is nothing to be done . ' ( " naobinomitama " ) .
** on the other hand , atsutane hirata considered magatsuhi no kami to be a god of goodness .
according to atsutane , magatsuhi no kami is the aramitama ( ferocious , rough , and violent side of the spirit ) of susanoo no mikoto .
he claimed that all humans have in their hearts , a portion of the divine spirit of magatsuhi no kami and a portion of the divine spirit of naobi no kami ( who atsutane considers is the nikitama - peaceful side of the spirit - of amaterasu omikami ) .
when people face evil and impurity , and respond with anger , hatred , and harshness , it is the act of the portion of the divine spirit of magatsuhi no kami in their hearts .
thus , he ( or she ) is a god governing the function which judges evil as evil in people ' s hearts .
he also explained that such anger was calmed over time by the portion of the divine spirit of naobi no kami .
** negi ( assistant to guji )
** nagi originates from the word ' negu ' meaning ' calming . '
this means praying for the protection from gods by calming their minds .
in ancient times , it referred to persons who pray for protection of gods or conduct exclusively religious services .
in the old system , it was a title lower than shinto priest and higher than hafuri , or the general term for shinto priesthood .
negi was the top priest at the kamo-jinja shrine , matsunoo-taisha shrine , hiyoshi-taisha shrine , and hirano-jinja shrine , and was second to onegi at katori-jingu shrine and kashima-jingu shrine .
in and after the meiji period , only ise-jingu shrine and shrines of a higher shrine ranking had the post of negi . .
after world war ii , the current system was established where all shrines have the post of negi .
** yoshida shinto
** " yoshida shinto " is a school of shinto perfected during the muromachi period by kanetomo yoshida , a shinto priest from the kyoto shida-jinja shrine .
also referred to as yuiitsu shinto ( one-and-only shinto ) , sogen shinto .
** according to the book , in gempon sogen shinto , ' " gen " illustrates the gen gen of unforeseen ying and yang .
" hon " illustrates the honbon of ichinen misho ( thoughts yet to be met ) .
( an omission ) " so " defines god as the origin in ikki mibun .
" gen " defines god as a form of wako dojin ( mingling with the world by hiding one ' s true talent or knowledge ) . '
therefore , ' this is the one and only true shinto since the beginning of the nation . '
** although it eventually declined , it ruled the shrines and shinto priests nationwide during the edo period as shinto honjo .
** tenjin-shinko faith
** " tenjin-shinko faith " is a belief in tenjin ( heavenly gods ) ( raijin ( god of lightning ) ) , specifically , a shinto faith with awe and prayers centered around sugawara no michizane as ' tenjin-sama . '
** summary
michizane , who was ousted from the daijin position in a conspiracy by fujiwara no tokihira , and degraded to dazaifu ( governmental office in chikuzen province ) , died in despair .
following his death , an epidemic spread , drought continued , and the imperial princes of emperor daigo died of diseases one after another .
additionally , the seiryo-den imperial palace was struck by lightning , resulting in many casualties .
the imperial court fearing that this was a curse from michizane , pardoned michizane ' s sin and conferred on him a posthumous rank .
** michizane ' s revengeful ghost was connected to raijin due to the lightning incident at the seiryo-den imperial palace .
originally , a jinushigami called karai tenjin was enshrined in the kitano district of kyoto , and the imperial court decided to build the kitano-tenmangu shrine to appease the curse of michizane ( see goryo-shinko faith ) .
additionally , the dazaifu-tenmangu shrine was built in dazaifu , where michizane died .
in 000 , in response to a story about seven pine trees growing overnight in front of the taishogun sha , which was the northwestern point for peace and control of naniwa-kyo , the osaka-tenmangu shrine ( tenman tenjin ) was built under imperial command .
in 000 , the shingo ' kitano-tenmangu daijin , ' was given ( literally , " shrine name " ) , which is the title given to a shinto shrine .
in addition , the shrine was also referred to as tenmandaijizai tenjin , nihondaijoitokuten , etc . and was feared as the shrine of a horrifying revengeful ghost .
** by the end of the heian period to the beginning of the kamakura period , it became less feared as a revengeful ghost .
according to " the tenjin engi " written at that time , tenjin-sama was worshipped as the god of mercy or god of honesty .
during the edo period , tenjin was worshipped as the god of learning , due to the fact that michizane was a great scholar and poet in real life .
** originally , karai tenjin was considered a god of lightning coming from the sky , and since lightning occurs with rain and rain is essential for growth of crops , it is also the god of agriculture .
additionally , kanjo ( ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location ) from kitano-tenmangu shrine and dazaifu-tenmangu shrine was frequently performed .
** the kitano-tenmangu shrine and the dazaifu-tenmangu shrine were established separately , and neither received kanjo from the other .
therefore , at the kitano-tenmangu shrine and the dazaifu-tenmangu shrine , the terms ' sohonsha ' and ' sohongu ' are not used , but instead are described as ' the birthplace of tenjin-shinko faith . '
** examples of tenjin-shinko faith
** hokuriku ( region west of tokyo on japan sea side of japan )
in fukui prefecture and toyama prefecture , when the eldest son is born , a tenjin zo ( wood carving or hanging scroll ) is displayed in the alcove every new year holiday , and in fukui , there is the custom of offering flatfish on january 00 .
the hanging scroll , etc . are given from the mother ' s side of the family .
additionally , in the other areas governed by the maeda domain , such as ishikawa prefecture , and neighboring areas , similar customs were practiced .
in kanazawa city , there was a custom of putting up wood carvings of tenjin and multiple servants until around 0000 .
the maeda family claims to have descended from the sugawara clan , and this is why the family crest is the plum blossom , which is the same as the shrine crest of tenjin .
the family crest of maeda family is called ' kenumebachi . '
** northern hiroshima prefecture
dolls , such as tenjin zo are given for baby ' s first sekku ( the boys ' festival ) .
see miyoshi ningyo .
** shinkai
** " shinkai " are ranks granted to shinto gods in japan .
also referred to as shini ( deity ) .
** shinkai are ranks granted to subjects that are also given to gods .
more precisely , ranks are granted to both humans and gods without distinction , and the ones granted to gods are called shinkai .
thus , its ranking structure is the same for subjects , and are composed of three types - ikai ( court rank ) , kuni ( or kunto ) ( order of merit ) , and honi ( history of japan ) .
** there are 00 levels in ikai for humans , ranging from shoshoige to shoichii ( senior first rank ) , but there are only 00 levels in ikai for gods , ranging from shorokui ( senior sixth rank ) to shoichii .
in 000 , shinkai of shorokui or higher was granted to the enshrined deities in shrines nationwide .
** kuni comes in 00 ranks for both humans and gods .
for humans , it was granted to those displaying deeds under arms , but was granted to others as well since the mid-0th century .
the same applies to gods .
there has been no kuni granted to gods from the 00th century onward .
** honi for humans are granted to the imperial family .
there are not many cases of honi being granted to gods .
exceptions are , in december 000 , ippon was granted to usa hachiman no daijin in buzen province , and nihon to its hime no kami .
** granting of shinkai was deliberated in meetings by the court nobles upon application from the department of worship and provinces , and decided after reporting to the emperor .
however , in the heian period , the department of worship and provincial governors frequently granted shinkai to their own .
since medieval times , the yoshida family also issued shinkai , and these were called sogen senji .
sogen senji were originally issued under imperial sanction by the emperor , but later , the yoshida family began issuing them on their own .
** originally , shinkai were granted to shrines .
this is because in ancient times , enshrined deities were unique to shrines .
when the enshrined deity was moved to another shrine , as a general rule , the shinkai was not inherited , and imperial sanction was necessary to inherit the shinkai .
however , with the fall of the ritsuryo system , the shinkai was inherited by the shrine to which the enshrined deity was moved .
for example , the shinkai of the fushimi inari taisha shrine is ' shoichii , ' and hence , the inari-jinja shrines nationwide which were transferred from there , also identify themselves as ' shoichii . '
** the shinkai system was abolished during the meiji period , but shinkai are seen in the names of some shrines today .
** azusayumi
** summary
** azusayumi as a makura word
** aazusayumi is a bow made of japanese cherry birch used for shinto rituals .
any bow can be called an azusayumi , regardless of the material it is made from .
** or it is a makura word ( poetic epithet convention )
** in the old days it was used as a bow ( meigen - resounding bowstrings ) that makes a sound for the amulet used in shinto rituals and childbirth .
the bow was presented to shrines in kyoto from kai and shinano provinces , and some examples are still in existence today ( three bows in shoso-in chuso storage ) .
** this word preceded spring ( a homonym of setting up the string ) and pulls in manyoshu ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) .
** mikogami
** in a shrine where parent-child gods ( shito religion ) are enshrined , the child god is called mikogami or byoei-shin ( descendant deity ) .
** the word ' mikogami ' is used when both parent and child gods are chief gods and when the parent as the chief god and its child are enshrined together .
in particular when mother-child gods are enshrined , it has something to do with the boshi-jin shinko , belief in mother-child gods .
** for example , yasaka-jinja shrine is dedicated to susanoo ( deity in japanese mythology ) in the center as the chief god , kushinadahime as god empress , kisakigami on its east side and ' yahashira-mikogami ' on its west side .
kasuga-taisha shrine has its ' wakamiya-sha shrine ' sessha ( auxiliary shrine - dedicated to a deity close-related to that of a main shrine ) , which is dedicated to amenooshikumone no mikoto , the mikogami of its chief god , amenokoyane no mikoto .
** this ' wakamiya , ' which is often a shrine dedicated to the mikogami of its chief god , means that not the dedicated god , but the shrine itself is young .
shrines developed later are also called ' wakamiya . '
in this case , some shrines are dedicated to the parent god as the chief god , or sosen shin ( ancestral god ) , whereas others call otabisho ( place where the sacred palanquin is lodged during a festival ) or branch shrines wakamiya .
therefore all wakamiya are not dedicated to mikogami .
** hasshin-den
** " hasshin-den " is the temple where the eight gods protecting the emperor are enshrined , built under the ritsuryo system in japan , in the sai-in ( western quarter ) of the department of worship .
** the following gods ( shinto ) are enshrined in the hasshin-den .
the notations are different in " engishiki " ( list of official shrines ) and " kogoshui , " but they refer to the same gods .
** by protecting the emperor , the nation is also protected .
therefore , in some instances , these eight gods were enshrined among people as well .
at the ceremony for the repose of the soul , nine gods , these eight gods plus the onaobinokami , are honored .
** according to some old diagrams at the hasshin-den , the main buildings enshrining each god were independent of one another , and the eight main buildings facing east extended north to south to the northwest of the sai-in in the department of worship .
torii ( shinto shrine gate ) were erected in front of three locations , from the north , the first shrine , the fifth shrine , and the eighth shrine .
hasshin-den is described in the engishiki jinmyocho as ' mikannagisai kamihachiza ' and is considered a renowned shrine .
** with the meiji restoration , the department of divinities was restored , and in 0000 , a temple for department of divinities was built and a senza-sai festival ( festival for transfer of a shinto shrine ) was held .
on this occasion , not only the eight gods of hasshin-den , but also the gods of heaven and earth and the souls of successive emperors were honored .
prior to this , the souls of successive emperors were honored at the kurodo ( structure used for private religious observances at the imperial palace ) in a buddhist ritual , but kurodo was abolished thereafter .
in october of the same year , the eight gods of hasshin-den were enshrined together with the gods of heaven and earth , and the name ' hasshin-den ' was abolished and renamed ' shinden . '
shinden is one of the palace sanctuaries inside the imperial palace .
additionally , among the eight gods , for omiyanomenokami , a shoshi ( small shrine ) honoring omiyanomenokami was built on the historic land of the sai-in at the department of worship .
** gion-shinko faith
** gozu tenno was originally a buddhist god , and the guardian deity of gion shoja temple .
it was influenced by taoism in china before arriving in japan , and it synchronized with the shinto god ( shinto ) , susanoo , in japan .
this is because gozu tenno and susanoo were both considered gyoyaku jin ( gods that spread epidemics ) .
yakushi nyorai ( bhaisaya , buddha able to cure all sickness ) was the honjibutsu ( original buddhist divinity ) .
** the original form of the gion-shinko faith was for the prevention of epidemics by solacing and calming the gyoyaku jin , based upon goryo-shinko faith , which developed during the heian period .
its religious festival was called ' gion goryo-e , ' and began being celebrated by the citizens of kyoto at the gion-sha shrine ( currently yasaka-jinja shrine ) in the latter half of the tenth century .
gion goryo-e became established as an annual celebration in june at the gion-sha shrine , and in 000 , became a festival where hohei ( offering a wand with hemp and paper streamers to a shinto god ) is performed by the imperial court .
this festival later became the gion-matsuri festival .
festival cars and floats mounted with decorative halberd entertain the gyoyaku jin , and are also meant to disperse the bad luck of gyoyaku jin .
by medieval times , the gion-shinko faith spread nationwide , gion-sha shrines or gozu-tennosha shrines enshrining gozu tenno were built , and goryo-e ( or tenno-sai festival ) were held as celebrations .
** gion-sha shrine in kyoto , which is the sohonsha , became yasaka-jinja shrine due to its place of enshrinement .
following kyoto , other shrines changed their names to yasaka-jinja shrine , to susano-jinja shrine from the name of the enshrined deity , to gion-jinja shrine from the previous shrine name , to names prefixed with geographic names , or to old shrine names used before enshrining gozu tenno .
** goryo-e
** rokusho goryo
** hassho goryo
** goryo originally meant spirit of a deceased person .
during the heian period , its meaning changed from shiryo ( spirit of a dead person ) of someone who died in an accident caused by onryo ( revengeful ghost ) .
natural disasters were all believed to be the acts of goryo , and this led to the creation of courtesies expressed to goryo .
additionally , during the heian period , on may 00 , 000 , goryo-e was held in the shinsen-en garden .
** emperor sudo , imperial prince iyo , fujiwara no yoshiko , tachibana no hayanari , and funya no miyatamaro were referred to as such , and became objects of goryo-e .
** additionally , the gion goryo-e ( gion-e ) at the yasaka-jinja shrine , where gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) is enshrined , is known as gion-matsuri festival
the pacification of sugawara no michizane , who was feared as the karai tenjin ( god of fire and thunder ) , is known nationwide as the tenjin-shinko faith .
** bunrei ( branch shrine for a deity )
** the bunrei or wakamitawa is a term used in the shinto religion that refers to a separated god or divine spirit when an enshrined deity of main shrine is dedicated to a different shrine .
transferring the separated spirit to a new shrine for chinsai ( religious ceremony for appeasing the gods ) is called kanjo .
it is also called bunshi , but bunshi may mean bunsen ( described below ) .
** a branch shrine to which a divided enshrined deity has been transferred is called " bunshi , " " bunsha , " or " imamiya . "
** in shinto religion , the divine spirit can be divided without limitation because it is believed that the original spirit power is not weakened and performs the same functions as the main shrine .
** in many kanjo cases , the deity is divided from the shrine from which the god originated and those shrines are called sohonsha or sohongu ( head shrine ) .
many shrines that received a separated deity have their names related to the original shrine .
the original shrine and branch shrines form a group of shrines .
for example , the sohonsha ( main shrine ) of inari-jinja shrines is fushimi inari-jinja shrine ; most inari-jinja shrine received a deity separated from fushimi inari-jinja shrine .
the sohonsha of hachiman-jinja shrine or yawata-jinja shrine is usa-jingu shrine
hachiman-jinja shrines or yawata-jinja shrines all over japan received a deity from either usa-jingu shrine , iwashimizu hachimangu shrine branched from usa-jingu shrine , or tsurugaoka hachimangu shrine a branch of iwashimizu .
** the word kanjo came from a buddhist term , which meant requesting the teaching of buddha and praying for saving all living things .
in japan , after the syncretization of shinto with buddhism it started to mean summoning the spirit of shinto and buddhist deities for praying and later it gradually changed to the current meaning .
** in case of the bunrei , all enshrined deities are separated .
** shinji
** " shinji " are worshipping and rituals related to god .
they involve prayers and consultation with god , and are often connected with a god of a specific religion .
it ' s also referred to as ' jinji . '
** some are performed by religious clergy , while others become public events .
many of the public events are tied to people ' s lives , who long for secular benefits and stability based upon their occupations , like agriculture and commerce .
in such cases , events combining various religions and indigenous faiths are often practiced in parallel or in combination .
** shinto
shinji in shinto also includes events for the general public , such as festivals and purification ceremonies
official ones are those performed by religious organizations like shrines , and include exorcism for specific things , ground-breaking ceremonies , and exorcism , and praying for traffic safety are often entrusted and performed by shrines .
influenced by synchronized shinto and buddhism , some shinto shinji were derived from ceremonies that include releasing captive animals .
** in addition to shinji praying for secular benefits , praying for rain , agriculture , and hunting were also practiced .
** shinji at religious festivals
** there are indirect acts for consulting god ' s will , such as shinji where fortune is told based upon the result of sumo , etc .
the religious meaning of such acts is not strongly felt , but there are many examples like this , such as competitions like yabusame ( horseback archery ) and kurabeuma ( horse racing ) , using objects and animals .
** dance performances are often shinji , and kagura ( ancient shinto music and dancing ) , such as miko no mai ( shrine maidens dancing ) and shishimai ( lion dance ) , is a classic shinji mai ( shinji dance ) .
in addition , many traditional performances , like noh plays , have elements of shinji in them .
** shinko-sai festival
** the shinko-sai festival is a shrine festival where the divine spirit makes an imperial visit .
it is also referred to as shinko shiki .
most of the festivals in which portable shrines or imperial carriages appear are a type of shinko-sai festival .
** shinko-sai festival ' means an ' imperial visit by god ' and broadly refers to the entire imperial visit ; narrowly conceived it refers to the process of the outward trip from the shrine to the destination such as otabisho .
in the latter , the term kanko-sai festival is used for the process of the return trip from the destination to the shrine .
the togyo-sai festival and kangyo-sai festival mean the same thing as the shinko-sai festival and the kanko-sai festival , and the togyo-sai festival also refers to the entire imperial visit ( togyo ) in a broad sense .
** summary
therefore , the place at which a god descended , such as the dwelling place of a god , became otabisho , and in many cases , are currently referred to as genkyu or the original enshrinement place .
** the flow of a shinko-sai festival heading to an otabisho is roughly as follows .
shinji ( shinto rituals ) for transferring the divine spirit to portable shrines , etc .
togyo from the shrine to the otabisho
shinji and dedication at the otabisho ( otabisho-sai ceremony )
kangyo from the otabisho to the shrine
shinji for returning the divine spirit
this process can take several days .
in processes 0 and 0 , the shrine parishioner ' s community is often visited .
if not heading to the otabisho , the divine spirit patrols the shrine parishioner ' s community , or an imperial visit is made to perform shinji at specific locations .
** miyadashi refers to taking the portable shrine outside the shrine ' s premises , and miyairi refers to the entry of the portable shrine into the shrine ' s premises after the visits .
these words are used when festival cars offered by children parading as tendo and the shrine parishioners exit and enter the shrine .
** togyo gyoretsu
** togyo is where many shrine parishioners can participate in the religious festival as carriers of the portable shrine , or in larger festivals , festival cars are used , shishimai ( lion dance ) , and dancing are included as part of the parade .
other than these , shinto priests , shrine maidens , children parading as tendo , festival cars , liondog , dancing , etc . , may also join the parade .
music during the journey of togyo varies , and often , gagaku ( old japanese court music ) is performed by shinto priests , or matsuri-bayashi ( japanese music ) and marching songs by shrine parishioners .
** most eye-catching in the parade is the portable shrine and festival car , shishimai , and dancing .
the portable shrine is carried in different ways depending upon the festival - some are carried solemnly , some with high spirits , some go on togyo by boat ( funatogyo ) , and some are carried in the water .
these styles of execution are associated with the enshrined deity , or are styles that were carried out sporadically , but became customary , and eventually a tradition .
** when togyo is performed during the night , a lantern procession is added and festival cars are also lit up .

** there are honsha jinin , who are under the direct control of shrines , and sanzai jinin , who live on the land of shrines in the provinces .
** jinin were armed guards at the front of shrines and at religious services , and thus , from the times of insei from the heian period to the muromachi period , records show that along with priest warriors , they frequently committed violence and organized petitions .
not only armed groups , but also performers , craftsmen , and merchants joined jinin , and over time , many commerce , industry , and entertainment guilds were organized by jinin .
** at the gion-sha shrine , lower ranking jinin called ' inu jinin ' served to clean the shrine , provided security at yama-hoko junko ( float procession ) , and had the privilege to participate in cleaning and attending funerals across kyoto .

** iwashimizu jinin at the iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine held monopoly rights at the fish market in yodo and also transportation rights over land and water , while oyamazaki jinin at the subordinate rikyu hachiman-gu shrine , held exclusive purchasing rights for egoma ( a type of perilla ) .
** " kaminchu " is the common name for shinto priests in ryukyu/okinawa .
** ryobu shinto
** in esoteric buddhism , the universe is considered to be the manifestation of dainichi nyorai ( mahavairocana ) .
it is represented in the rules written in the ryokai mandala kongokai mandala centered around dainichi nyorai and also in the ryokai mandala taizo mandara .
the butsu bosatsu drawn in the mandalas of the two realms , vajradhatsu ( diamond realm ) and garbhadhatsu ( womb realm ) , were considered the true forms of buddha , and god ( shinto ) was interpreted as its manifested form .
** the birth of ryobu shinto can be traced back to the introduction of buddhism .
** with the official introduction of buddhism , shinto , the faith in japan since ancient times , was significantly challenged .
shinzen dokkyo ( reading buddhist sutras to god ) was introduced , believing that japanese gods were also seeking nirvana through buddhism , jingu-ji temples were built on the premises of shrines , and statues of god were made under the influence of buddhism .
** in the latter half of the heian period , buddhist shinto theory was developed by monks as a religious principle explaining shinto theoretically .
among the two esoteric buddhism that were mainstream in those days , the one adopting the teachings of the tendai sect was sanno shinto , and the one adopting the teachings of the shingon sect was ryobu shinto .
** both use the religious principles of esoteric buddhism , mainstream at that time , to explain oharae no kotoba and to describe the gods and enshrined deities of shrines that appeared in japanese mythology .
** both were based on apocryphal books using saicho , kukai , etc . as a pretext for selectors , and were instructed as secrets of each shrine , or in some cases , became known among people through shugendo ( japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating shinto and buddhist concepts ) .
these were theorized in the kamakura period , and later generated many shinto theologies .
** the naiku and geku of ise jingu shrine are of the two realms , vajradhatsu and garbhadhatsu , and these two realms combined as one constitutes ise jingu shrine , the manifestation of dainichi nyorai .
( nigu-ikko )
** in addition , it was considered that the seven generations of gods in the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) was equal to shichibutsutsukaige , and represents the stars of the big dipper .
izanagi and izanami , kami-sha and shimo-sha of suwa-jinja shrine were also compared to the mandalas of the two realms .
** ryobu shinto greatly influenced the development of shinto theologies later on , and became the mainstream of shugo shinto theory in medieval times , generating many branches including goryu and sanrin .
** during the meiji period , ryobu shinto was dealt a devastating blow by the separation of buddhism and shintoism in the first year of meiji . this resulted in it losing its status as the mainstream shinto doctrine .
** tawara no onda
** " tawara no onda " is a shinji ( shinto ritual ) performed every year on may 0 , at the taji-jinja shrine in the tawara district of hiyoshi-cho , nantan city , kyoto prefecture .

** yaotome
** beside " 八乙女 , " in kanji , yaotome is given the following : 八社女 , 八少女 , and 八乎止女 .
also the term of yaotome is shortened to " yame . "
** however the number of performers was not originally set as eight ; the word ' eight ' is considered to have meant multiple or large numbers .
** it is believed that the yaotome originates from shrine maidens who served food to emperor keiko and the gods in the ancient daijo-sai festival ( a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor ) held by the emperor .
in later years jingikan ( department of worship ) selected court ladies from provinces to have them perform such services .
this had an influenced on other shrines , that set up the post of miko who originally performed similar services and who were later involved in shinto rituals .
** the yaotome of kasuga-taisha shrine and itsukushima-jinja shrine was renowned in the old days and today yaotome mai ( dance by yaotome ) performed at miho-jinja shrine , kotohira-gu shrine , and toyokuni-jinja shrine are also well known .
** geographical name
yaotome-ura ( yura , tsuruoka city , yamagata prefecture ) : it was named after the eight beautiful ladies who welcomed prince hachinoko by performing a dance .
** yaotome-dokutsu cave ( yura , tsuruoka city , yamagata prefecture ) : its entrance was covered by rocks destroyed in sakata earthquake that occurred in the meiji period .

** daishogun ( hoi-jin )
** recent examples
** all were star gods related to venus , representing knives in gogyo-setsu ( the theory of the five elements ) , which made them feared as araburu kami ( malignant gods ) in terms of the almanac and orientation .
** daishogun changes location every three years , and the direction was considered bad luck for everything , especially activities involving soil .
since the direction of the daishogun does not change for three years , to dread that direction was referred to as ' sannen fusagari ' ( blocked for three years ) .
however , yugyo bi ( day of wandering ) for daishogun was set , and misfortune would not occur during that time .
the direction depending upon the year , based on the 00 signs of the chinese zodiac , is as follows .
** year of the boar , rat ( 00 signs of chinese zodiac ) , and ox - west
year of the tiger , hare , and dragon - north
year of the serpent , horse , and ram - east
year of the monkey , bird , and dog - south
** the yugyo bi are as follows .
** doyo ( last 00 days of the season ) of spring ( before the first day of summer ) : kinoene no hi - tsuchinoetatsu no hi ( wanders to the east )
doyo of summer ( before the first day of fall ) : hinoene no hi - kanoetatsu no hi ( wanders to the south )
doyo of fall ( before the first day of winter ) : kanoene no hi - kinoetatsu no hi ( wanders to the west )
doyo of winter ( before the first day of spring ) : mizunoene no hi - hinoetatsu no hi ( wanders to the north )
** daishogun was considered to be the son of gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) , and was equated with susanoo .
( however , gozu tenno later synchronized with susanoo . )
** in kyoto , emperor kanmu placed daishogun-jinja shrines enshrining daishogun in four directions , immediately after relocating the capital to heian-kyo ( ancient kyoto ) .
** east okazaki , sakyo ward
west kamiyagawa , kamigyo ward
north daitokujimonmae , kita ward , kyoto city
south location unknown
however , their current locations are as follows .
these now enshrine susanoo .
** east higashisanjo taishogun-jinja shrine in higashiyama ward .
** west daishogunhachi-jinja shrine in kamigyo ward .
** north imamiya-jinja shrine ( kyoto city ) , sessha eki-jinja shrine , and nishigamo taishogun-jinja shrine in kita ward .
** south premises of fujimori-jinja shrine in fushimi ward .
** additionally , gion-sha shrine ( yasaka-jinja shrine ) also enshrines daishogun .
daishogun also remains as geographical names in kita ward ( kyoto city ) .
** in april 0000 , television and magazines reported news on many households rejecting sewer work in yamagata city , resulting in delay .
the number one reason for rejecting the work was ' economic reasons ' and the second most common reason was ' daishogun . '
year 0000 was the year of the dragon , and daishogun was in the north , which resulted in delays in work due to many residents having bathrooms and restrooms in the north side of their homes .
this proves that in this country , katatagae jujutsu ( witchcraft for changing directions to avoid bad luck ) remains strong even when the twenty-first century is just around the corner .
** reikoden-tenmangu shrine
** reikoden-tenmangu shrine is a shrine in kamigyo ward , kyoto city .

** chokusai
** chokusai is a religious service at a shrine where imperial messengers are sent by the emperor .
particularly in the modern ages , the term " chokusai-sha shrine " is used for shrines where imperial messengers are regularly sent .
in many cases , it is the regular festival of the shrine .
the imperial messengers assigned are in principle , the shoten , who attend to religious services in the imperial court .
** chokusai with special content that refer to old styles that preserve traditional ceremonies , are called ' san chokusai . '
examples of san chokusai are ; the kamo-matsuri festival ( aoi-matsuri festival ) of the kamo-jinja shrine , iwashimizu-sai festival of the iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine , and kasuga-matsuri festival of the kasuga-taisha shrine .
imperial messengers , wearing old ceremonial court dress , following customs from the pre-edo period are sent , and people who also dress according to ancient fashion attend as ' representations ' of accompanying government officials of the overseeing department , and others .
these people , along with the priests of the shrine , perform the service according to the ceremony program .
however , various changes are taking place , such as in the iwashimizu-sai festival , where iwashimizu hojoe with strong characteristics of syncretism of shinto and buddhism is being inherited , and is increasingly leaning towards shinto .
the costumes are also gradually differing from ancient fashion as they are repeatedly renewed .
** at these chokusai , imperial messengers use kimono and ancient head-dress ( similar to the ' formal dress ' defined by jinja honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) ) , and their conduct is mostly fixed .
** amenouzume
** amenouzume ( amanouzume ) is a deity who appears in japanese shinto mythology .
she is the goddess of entertainment who appears in the story of ' iwatokakure ' and can be said to be the oldest dancer in japan .
in chinese characters , her name is written as 天宇受賣命 in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) and 天鈿女命 in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** story described in the mythology
when amaterasu omikami hid herself in the ama no iwato ( cave of heaven ) , the world became dark . embarrassed by this , the deities gathered at ama no yasukawa to hold a conference .
they conducted various rituals in front of the iwato according to the proposal made by omoikane .
when amenouzume declared , " a deity nobler than you has been born , " the resulting laughter enticed amaterasu omikami to open the iwato a little in order to take a peek .
at that moment , amaterasu omikami was pulled out by amenotajikarao and the world became bright again .
** just as ninigi was descending from heaven during tensonkorin ( the ceremonial descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) , along came a deity who was illuminating the entire area from takamagahara all the way to ashihara no nakatsukuni .
amaterasu and takamimusubi urged amenouzume on , saying " you should ask him who he is , because even though you may be a weak woman , you never grow timid when meeting others , " so she asked him his name .
the deity ' s name was sarutahiko , who was both an amatsu kami ( god of heaven ) and a kunitsukami ( god of the earth ) , and it turned out he had come to meet them in order to serve as their guide .
so amenouzume followed ninigi and descended from heaven as one of the itsutomonoo ( the five clan chiefs ) , together with the other four , amenokoyama no mikoto ( a legendary ancestor deity ) , futodama , tamanooya no mikoto and ishikoridome .
as amenouzume revealed the name of sarutahiko , she started to serve under this name and became the soshin ( ancestor honored as deity ) of sarumenokimi .
it is also said that she became sarutahiko ' s wife .
** amenouzume gathered together many fish , both large and small , and asked them whether they would be willing to work for tenson ( ninigi ) .
all answered " we will serve " except the sea cucumber , who remained silent , so amenouzume slashed open its mouth with a knife .
this is the reason why a sea cucumber ' s mouth is split .
** origin of amenouzume
the theory that , because she often made the gods laugh , she was the patron goddess of the entertainment professions ( like performers and comedians ) , tends in the kansai region to take priority over other interpretations .
in fact , the amenouzume enshrined at meta-jinja shrine in yamato province has historically been widely worshipped as the shiso shin of entertainment .
however , the description recorded of her dance can also be interpreted " she danced while possessed " and thus , she was not dancing in order to provoke laughter .
it seems that her dancing gave expression to the powerful lower half of her body .
** the original form of just such dances as the one amenouzume gave in front of amanoiwato could also be seen during festivals to the gods , and in particular during the ancient oracle festivals that are thought to have been conducted by shamans ( kannagi ) .
the episode of amenouzume is a legend that tells the story of a miko ( shrine maiden ) who served the ancient deities .
** a typical example which illustrates the above is ' takachiho night kagura ' conducted in takachiho-cho , nishiusuki-gun , miyazaki prefecture .
okami in this kagura is owadatsumi no kami .
** such a dance ( which was danced by a medium known as a kannagi to sacred music called kamikura , kagura , or kamiasobi ) was performed to consol the deities and restore their power .
a description of ' takumini wazaogi o nashi ' appears in the nihonshoki , and it means a performer entertaining an audience with the skills bestowed upon him/her by the deities .
as shown by the fact that the above is the origin of the word ' actor , ' it is certain that these festivals of kaguramai ( dance for kagura ) were the starting point of japanese public entertainment .
** this is considered as the one which evolved from the festivals for the sun god mentioned above .
it can be easily understood by directing attention to the background that the yamato dynasty worshipped the sun god = amaterasu and professed that the dynasty descended from her .

** daikokuten
** summary
** indian mikkyo/tibetan buddhism
** japanese buddhism/mikkyo
** daikoku and ebisu
** folk beliefs
** principal shrines and temples that enshrine daikokuten
** daikokuten means maha kala ( sanskrit : , transliteration : 摩訶迦羅 ) that is a reincarnation of shiva , a deity of the hindu religion .
** daikokuten of mikkyo ( esoteric buddhism )
it is a deity of mikkyo evolved from maha kala .
** daikokuten of buddhism
in buddhism , daikokuten is a deity that has its origins in the daikokuten of mikkyo and is one of the tenbu ( deities who reside in the heavenly realms ) .
( original buddhism denies the existence of deities and polytheism . )
( even at present , some sects of buddhism deny the existence of deities and polytheism . )
** daikokuten of the shinto religion
it is a deity of the shinto religion that was created by combining daikokuten of mikkyo and okuninushi no mikoto , so called syncretism of buddhism and shinto , and known as one of shichifukujin ( seven deities of good luck ) .
** maha kala , an incarnation of the hindu deity shiva , was adopted into the indian mikkyo religion .
it was named daikokuten ( 大黒天 ) because " maha " means big ( 大 ) ( or great ) and " kala " means time or black ( 黒 ) ( darkness ( 暗黒 ) ) .
it is also translated into chinese characters as 大暗黒天 ( daiankokuten ) .
as its name suggests , daiankokuten is a goho zenjin ( good deity that protects dharma ) with a blue-black body and angry countenance .
** it was introduced into japan together with mikkyo .
in japan , the term of daikokuten normally refers to japan ' s own deity that was created by combining it with okuninushi no mikoto of the shinto religion , such as the statue of daikokuten ( 大国天 : daikokuten ) enshrined at kanda myojin shrine .
** hindu religion
maha kala has three aspects ; namely , those relating to battle , good fortune , and the underworld .
as a deity that presides over violations of buddhist precepts and battles , maha kala resides in shirin ( cemeteries ) , excels in ongyo ( disappearance and concealment ) and flying , and devours blood and meat .
people believed that they could win a battle by worshipping it .
a deity of fortune , maha kala is enshrined in indian temples as an incarnation of vishnu or jiten .
as a deity of the underworld , he is deemed as the same deity as enmaten and resides in the tsuka ( mound ) .
** since mahakala--or in other words , shiva--was introduced into mikkyo without modification , daikokuten was initially depicted in the same manner as shiva , showing his four hands holding a trident , a staff , a ring , and a rope .
later , however , brahma and vishnu were absorbed into daikokuten ( maha kala ) to create a figure with three faces , six arms , and an angry countenance that corresponded to the trimurti of the hindu religion ( brahma , vishnu and shiva ) .
** daikokuten eventually began to be depicted as the dharma guardian who defeats hinduism and ensures the victory of buddhism by crushing shiva and his wife parvati ( or negasha , in some versions ) underfoot--despite the ironic fact that daikokuten originally evolved from shiva .
in tibet , mongolia and nepal , daikokuten was worshipped by traders as a god of wealth and in tibet , a folk belief in daikokuten as a god of good luck began to spread .
** daikokuten was introduced into japan together with mikkyo and was believed to be one of the guardian deities of buddhism called tenbu .
he was also considered a deity of battle and war , a deity of good fortune , or a deity of the kitchen and dinning room .
but the reason many daikokuten statues in japan feature fukutokuso ( a happy , contented facial expression ) is due to the influence of china , where of the three aspects of mahakala the one most emphasized and worshipped was that of wealth .
** daikokuten was originally expressed as the statue of ichimen nihi or sanmen roppi with a blue-black or black body and funnuso ( fury ) .
although the height of a standing statue of nihi is normally 0 . 00 m , this can vary .
statues of such figures were produced until the kamakura period .
** almost all statues have just one face , but as belief in daitokuten proliferated throughout japan , sanmen ( three-faced ) daikokuten , which combine daikokuten , bishamonten , and benzaiten into one body , began to appear .
though uncommon , there also exists statues with funnuso such as the standing statue of daikokuten enshrined at kanzeon-ji temple ( fukuoka prefecture ) .
** as daikokuten was introduced together with mikkyo , it was worshipped by the shingon and the tendai sects .
in the muromachi period , it was also eagerly worshipped in the nichiren sect .
incidentally , the contents of the bag symbolizing daikokuten is said to be seven kinds of treasures .
** shinto religion
** initially , daikokuten was worshipped as a deity of destruction and abundant harvest .
later the destructive aspect dropped away to leave only the abundant harvest aspect , which is how daikokuten , known as " daikokusama , " became the god presiding over food and wealth , and was counted one of the seven shichifukujin .
starting in the muromachi period , belief in daikokuten began to merge with folk belief in " okuninushi no mikoto , " which is why daikokuten statues with smiling faces started to appear .
beginning in the edo period , statues of daikokuten showing him perched atop a bag of rice , perhaps the most well-known type of daikokuten statue today , began to appear .
nowadays , daikokuten is usually depicted as a very wealthy man standing on a bag of rice and holding both a fukubukuro ( lit . " lucky bag " ) and an uchidenokuzochi ( a magic wand ) .
** statues of both daikokuten and suserihime no mikoto , his wife , are enshrined as a married couple at izusan-jinja shrine .
** although both daikoku and ebisu are independent deities of shichifukujin , they are usually worshipped as a pair in the same way as the pair of jurojin ( deity of longevity ) and fukurokuju ( tall headed deity of happiness , wealth and long life ) .
from long ago , ebisumai ( ebisu dancing ) and daikokumai ( daikoku dancing ) have been widely known among various kinds of kagura ( sacred music and dancing performed at shrines ) .
this is believed to be due to the fact that daikoku is the deity of agriculture that brings about a good harvest and ebisu is the deity of fishery that brings about a plentiful catch .
daikokuten has also been worshipped as a deity of commerce because the products of agriculture and fishery used to be the main commodities for trading .
** in shinto folk religion , various beliefs exist about kodakara ( children ) and kozukuri ( making babies ) ; under such beliefs , statues of daikokuten atop a bag of rice ( see photograph ) are thought to represent the male sex organ .
more specifically , folk belief holds that his hat , body , and rice bag represent the tip of the penis , the penis itself , and the scrotum , respectively .

** kannazuki
** kannazuki ( kaminashizuki ) is an another name for october ( lunar calendar ) in japan .
today , it is also used as an another name for october in the solar calendar .
** although there are several views on the origin of the word ' kannazuki ( 神無月 ) ' ( refer to october ) , ' 神無 ' is a chinese character used as a phonetic symbol rather than for its meaning .
but because the term is written with the chinese characters " 神無 " ( lit . " there are no gods " ) , it is widely believed to be a month during which the deities disappear from the land .
in other words , during the month of october all the regions of japan other than izumo are emptied of their gods , because all the gods in the entire land assemble at izumo taisha shrine to discuss the year ' s events .
in fact , october in the lunar calendar is called kamiarizuki ( literally a month when deities are around ) in izumo province .
consequently , the etymological explanation of the term as coming from " the month of no gods " has become quite deep-rooted .
** various views surrounding ' kannazuki '
it is generally believed that deities gather at izumo taisha shrine to discuss matchmaking .
consequently , in sado province there used to be a local custom of avoiding any marriage proposals during the tenth month .
furthermore , in kitakyushu the custom used to be for unmarried men and women to seclude themselves in shrines on the days when the gods departed for and returned home from izumo .
it was amidst such theories that the concept of a " rusugami , " or " god who remains home , " was developed .
ebisu is most often thought to be a rusugami , though some regions celebrate ebisuko , or gatherings at which people worship ebisu , during the tenth month .
kamiarizuki
** in izumo , shinto rituals associated with " kamiarizuki " are held during the tenth month--according to the lunar calendar--at izumo taisha shrine as well as several other shrines .
** following this , the kamiari-sai festival is held from october 00 thru 00 ( according to the lunar calendar ) based on the belief that the gods are holding a meeting at izumo taisha shrine during this period .
on october 00 of the lunar calendar , the ' karasade-matsuri festival , ' a festival to bid farewell to the deities , is held in the haiden ( a building for worshipping deities ) of izumo taisha shrine .
juku-sha shrine , thought to be where the gods stay during their visit , is located inside the hedges of izumo taisha shrine .
** sakaki
** the sakaki ( cleyera japonica ) is an evergreen tree that belongs to the cleyera species of the theaceae family .
the sakaki is of paramount importance in shinto rituals , and is frequently used as a ritual offering at both household shinto altars and shinto shrines .
** features
the tree has thick , oval-shaped alternate leaves that have a smooth , leather-like surface and no serrated edges .
small and white flowers blossom in june .
it bears small black sap fruits around november .
** closely-related species
the hisakaki ( eurya japonica ) can be a substitute for the cleyera japonica .
** the hamahisakaki ( eurya emarginata ) , which is closely related to the eurya japonica , grows wild on the coast and is often planted along streets .
its leaves are round and clearly different from the leaves of the sakaki and the hisakaki .
it flowers in winter and smells like the hisakaki .
** culture
sakaki branches are also offered on household altars and replaced twice a month , on the first and fifteenth of every month ( up thru the edo period , they were replaced on the first and fifteenth of each month according to the old lunar calendar ) .
** sakaki began to be used in shinto rituals because since ancient times people believed that gods sometimes choose to dwell in plants , and what ' s more , branches with pointed leaves ( like the sakaki branch ) are considered yorishiro ( objects that represent the gods ) .
branches from evergreens like young pines and michelia compressa were also used until recently , when the sakaki and hisakaki grew in popularity thanks to the fact that they are the most commonly occuring planets with the sort of pointed leaves appropriate to be yorishiro .
** the name " sakaki " ( lit . " border tree " ) is thought to be referring to the notion of the tree as standing on the border between the gods and humankind .
some suggest that the name comes from ' proliferating trees ' because it is an evergreen tree and proliferates , but many scholars consider it as far-fetched and disagree .
** the sakaki is commonly found in household gardens in rural areas .
it is also a popular choice for home gardening because it is an evergreen .
** because the sakaki tree grows mostly only in the southern kanto where the climate is relatively mild , a hisakaki of a related species ( but different genus ) is substituted for the sakaki in areas further north .
** some suggest that the hisakaki comes from ' hime sakaki ' literally meaning ' princess sakaki ' because it is small ; other suggest it originates from the meaning of ' non sakaki . '
the hisakaki is a plant that can be offered to household buddhist altars .
it blooms flowers in early spring that have a distinct smell .
** the leaf edges helps tell the sakaki from the hisakaki .
the hisakaki has smaller and toothed ( with rough edges ) leaves , whereas the sakaki has slick-surfaced leaves with no rough edges .
the sakaki can also be identified by its claw-like shoot apices ( winter buds ) .
** in recent years , the vast majority of sakaki or hisakaki branches sold in stores in japan for use on shinto altars are from trees grown in china and are imported by japanese companies .
** fu or kannagi ( female spiritual medium )
** abilities of the fu or kannagi
** the fu or kannagi , also called " fugeki , " refers to those who worship and serve gods and take responsibility for conveying gods will to secular people .
such women were called kannagi , while such men were called geki or shuku .
it means " 神和 , " which literally means harmony with the gods .
** shamans in the japanese tradition correspond closely to the shamanism practiced by certain groups of indigenous siberians , native americans , and africans .
** it commonly refers to a person who had the responsibility of conveying a divine message ( oracle ) after having ' gods fallen ' into his or her own body .
most ancient shinto priests worked as fu or kannagi .
in a society where government was not separated from religious rituals , the oracles they gave had the power to control a nation ' s policies .
** the term of ' kannagi ' refers particularly to such a profession in japan .
the term " kannushi , " which today is generally used to refer to shinto priests , originally referred to the professional group responsible for deciding the status of the gods , much as one might expect from the chinese characters used--神主 , or literally " god-master . "
in japan , most kannagi have historically been female ; such women are typically called " miko " or " fujo . "
in early ancient japan , however , quite a few men fulfilled the same role as a female miko , and such men were called ' fugeki , ' ' okannagi , ' or ' miko ' .
today , the word " miko " is usually used to refer simply to the female assistants of shinto priests .
in some regions , the profession of a fu or kannagi may be termed ' itako . '
** in okinawa prefecture and its surrounding area , where different historical circumstances existed than in japan ' s home islands , a religious vocation called " noro " has existed since even before the foundation of the ryukyu kingdom , and still exists today .
the noro can be regarded as having the same power and authority as the kannagi in ancient times of japan .
many ethnologists use the case of the noro as evidence to reconstruct the nature of ancient japanese religious belief .
** however , neither opinion is backed by evidence .
** the fu or kannagi is regarded as a person having the following abilities .
** the fu or kannagi has the power or authority to communicate with the occult , such as gods or holy spirits in the divine , spiritual , and natural worlds .
they " communicate " or " exchange information . "
** in other words , they are regarded as having the supernatural power to communicate with paranormal entities , enabling them to give appropriate advice to those seeking an oracle .
** however , a recent study has pointed out that some of the kannagi who gave oracles may have been gifted with far more practical abilities .
namely , they have abilities to collect information and make a decision from a political point of view .
** for instance , apollo ' s oracle in delphi , greece had great authority in ancient greece .
delphi attracted many people including messengers of city states all over the country as well as those who seek opportunities in a lively city .
priests who gave oracles , in effect , collected information on regions and rumors on the street from people coming to delphi and independently comprehended the world situation by piecing the collected information together .
** in japan , himiko ( first known ruler of japan ) is considered to have acted as a miko of the yamatai-koku kingdom .
also some have the opinion that women acting as miko formed a part of the state authority of yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) .
some suggest that in ancient japan , whose political system was based on saisei icchi ( theocracy ) , miko participated in politics in this manner .
** mihashira no uzuno miko
** mihashira no uzuno miko refers to final three deities that came into the world when izanagi came back from yominokuni ( hades ) and cleansed dirtiness from the yomi ( world after death ) , according to the kiki-shinwa ( the kojiki , nihonshoki and mythology ) .
it is also called sankishi or sankishin .
** amaterasu
- a goddess born from the left eye of izanagi .
the sun goddess .
** tsukuyomi
- a god born from the right eye of izanagi ( some say it is a goddess ) .
the moon god governing night .
** susanoo
- a god born from the nose of izanagi .
the sea god .
** kotodama
** summary
** the kotodama of other cultural regions
** kotodama was usually the spiritual power believed to be contained within words in japan .
it was also called kotodama ( 言魂 ) .
the seion ( a silent consonant ) of kotodama was the law of fifty japanese syllables of kototama forming shinrabansho ( everything in nature ) .
the academic field devoted to studying kototama is called kototamagaku .
** it was believed that spoken words had some kind of influence on actual phenomena ; that is , good things happened when good words were spoken , while ominous things happened when unlucky words were spoken .
because of this , all steps were taken to be sure that there would be no mistake in reading during the shokushi ( reciting a shinto prayer ) to the emperor .
even today there are taboo words that should never be used at weddings or other such occasions , and these words have their origins in the concept of kotodama .
japan was thought to have become a fortunate land through the power of kotodama , a so-called " land of happy kotodama . "
** this was from a general notion that ' koto ' ( 言 ) and ' koto ' ( 事 ) were the same from ancient times .
** the act of speaking out one ' s own will was called ' kotoage ' ( literally to speak out the word ) and a bad result would be brought about if it was based on one ' s pride .
since he had spoken out of pride , takeru was cursed by the god and died .
in another words , the ideology of kotodama was not the simple animistic ideology that god resided in everything , rather it represented the existence of the mind .
** there were ideologies seen in other cultural regions similar to kotodama .
it is not known where the wind came from or where it goes .
a life is born when the wind blows . '
the reference to ' wind ' here was ' spiritus . '
** in general , sound or words were believed to have the effect to chase away evil souls or spirits .
this was performed in festivals , celebrations , or to get rid of evil spirits everywhere all around the world .
examples of the power of sound include the drums used during shinto rituals and the flutes , bells , and drums used during carnivals .
** even the spiritual power of words were used as incantations or the command of the emperor .
however , there are different interpretations of what the main ' koto ' ( 事 ) ( event ) was .
this differed greatly depending upon culture , era , and individuals .
** kamikaze
** kamikaze of genko ( the invasion of mongols in 0000 and 0000 )
** shinpuren no ran ( shinpuren rebellion )
** train and planes
** kamikaze of world war ii
** the ' kamikaze ' of herodotus
** kamikaze ( also called as kamukaze and shinpu ) was shinto vocabulary .
it meant wind blown by god .
** and yamato hime no mikoto , who made an appearance in ancient myths as one who received an oracle from amaterasu omikami , said " i think the divine wind resides in this province . "
this term , " of the divine wind , " was the most common poetic epithet used to refer to ise .
** the violent wind that supposedly blew during the genko .
it is now thought to have been a typhoon , or possibly a violent gale caused by a cyclone , that passed by western japan at that moment by chance .
the armies of the yuan and goryeo dynasties that invaded japan were defeated due to this wind .
** it was a rebellion caused by a group of samurai against the meiji government at kumamoto-jo castle in 0000 .
it is also called shinpu no hen .
the term " ren " was used in kumamoto to delineate local societies .
please refer to shinpuren no ran for more details .
** the shinpuren , with their undercurrent of extreme patriotism , held a restorationist , anti-foreign philosophy , and as such were deeply opposed to the bakufu ' s policy of opening the country .
the name of the shinpuren ( keishin party ) came from the shinto religion .
** among works that refer to this are the " hojo no umi , volume 0 , ' honba ' " ( ' runaway horses , ' volume 0 , the sea of fertility ) by yukio mishima .
** starting the next day , ' kamikaze ' was used for the name of their regular trains on this line ; they continued running until 0000 as promotional trains of daiki .
in addition , a classical piece called piano concerto no . 0 , inspired by the ' divine wind ' of the airplane ' s crew , was composed by hisato ozawa of kobe .
** kamikaze ' greatly influenced the later ideology of japan .
the " kamikaze " created by the special attack teams was to subdue the armies of the allied forces like the kamikaze that chased away the genko .
the word , " enkamikaze " became familiarized in various nations afterwards as an attack without any regard to danger imposed on oneself .
** the kamikaze was used as an adjective to describe suicide bombing terrorism of al-qaeda by various media ( european media as well as those on the arabic side ) .
kamikaze in english and 神風 ( kamikaze ) in japanese is an example of a foreign derived word that differs from the original definition of the word .
another example is the postwar practice , even in japan , of calling out-of-control taxis " kamikaze taxis " .
** *right before the end of world war ii , an escort carrier of the american pacific fleet , unaware of the significant threat typhoons represented , went straight into an area suffering a typhoon .
it suffered damage similar to that from an air attack at the end of the war .
** greek mythology states that this wind was caused by the god called boreas , who brought the cold wind from northern greece during winter and occasionally caused great destruction .
** the myth in which boreas abducts princess orithyia of classical athens was well known and often depicted in art objects , and the people of classical athens considered boreas to be their kinsman .
** moreover , " the north wind and the sun " , one of aesop ' s fables , is said to be originally describing the dealings between boreas and the sun god apollo .

** engishiki is the only sandai-kyakushiki that remains in almost perfect shape .
and since it stipulated detailed matters , it is an important resource in the study of ancient history .
** in 000 , fujiwara no tokihira and others began the compilation by emperor daigo ' s order .
after tokihira ' s death , fujiwara no tadahira continued the task , and it is generally completed in 000 .
forty years later , it was enforced in 000 , after some revisions .
** it consists of the 00 volumes and about 0000 articles .
according to the ritsuryo codes , the volumes contains as follows :
** volumes 0-00 jingikan ( department of worship ) .

volumes 0 and 00 serve as an engishiki jinmyocho ( list of shrines ) listing 0000 shrines that should receive kinensai ( prayer service for a good crop ) hohei ( offering a wand with hemp and paper streamers to a shinto god ) .
the shrines which are listed in engishiki jinmyocho were generally called shikinai-sha .
it was a shrine ranking , and the imperial court regarded the listed shrines in those days .
many of them have disappeared or became unknown .
** daijokan and hassho code
the volume 00 , minbusho ( ministry of popular affairs ) i , stated that counties and villages of countries should be named in two characters .
therefore , geographical names had been changed throughout the country .
** the volume 00 is minbusho ii .
** the volume 00 is account office ( kazue-ryo ) i , which contains assignments of yo , soyocho , and chunan sakumotsu tax in the nation .

** kokugaku
** kokugaku was a study that took place in the mid-edo period in japan .
it was one of the studies that represented the edo period along with ran gaku ( dutch learning ) .
it was also called wagaku , kochogaku , kogaku , and kodogaku .
** yet the methodology of kokugaku was heavily influenced by jinzai ito ' s kogigaku ( a confucian school ) and by sorai ogyu ' s kobunjigaku ( study of ancient rhetoric ) even though kokugaku scholars criticized these schools .
kokugaku rejected the moral philosophy of both confucianism and buddhism , which forced people to repress natural human emotions , instead placing value on the natural expression of human emotions .
** it appeared as a form to criticize medieval kagaku ( study of japanese poems called waka ) that lost it ' s popularity during the edo period .
the criticisms that started with katsutoshi kinoshita and mosui toda continued in the research of " manyoshu " ( the collection of ten thousand leaves ) conducted by choryu ( also pronounced " nagaru " ) and keichu shimokobe .
in particular , the tendency towards positivism seen in keichu ' s work was greatly praised for raising the academic standards of research into the classics .
in addition , azumamaro kadano , a shinto priest of fushimi inari shrine , contributed his " kodoron " ( theory on the ancient ways ) , in which he tried to recapture the essence of ancient japan by studying shinto and the japanese classics .
kamo no mabuchi formalized kokugaku as academia by even incorporating some contradictions made by keichu and kokugaku of azumamaro kadano .
mabuchi rejected confucian thought and believed that the true spirit of the ancient japanese was to be found in the " manyoshu " , devoting his life to researching it .
** atsutane hirata , a disciple of norinaga ' s , later developed the ideas expressed in norinaga ' s " kodoron " into the " fukko shinto " ( restored shinto ) , a new form of shinto .
atsutane ' s ideas also frequently found expression in works such as " suito hiroku " and " kondo hisaku " by his disciple , the intellectual nobuhiro sato .
** kokugaku , which stressed positivism became the basis of modern japanese literature , national language , and ethnology studies because of the work of kiyonori konakamura .
** yomi
** myth or theories concerning yomi
** nihonshoki ( the record of japanese history commissioned by the emperor )
** izumo no kuni fudo ki ( the endemic record of izumo prefecture )
** yomi in china
** yomi is the world of the dead .
the term originally meant ' underground spring ' in classical chinese , but its meaning gradually changed to mean the underground world of the dead .
so when the word " yomi " arrived in japan , it became linked with the land of the dead as conceived by the japanese at the time .
another theory holds that yomi comes from " yomo " ( all four directions/sides ) , simply expressing the concept that it is what lies beyond the world of everyday life .
aside from this , there is a separate view that yomi originated from yami ( 闇 ) .
** kojiki ( the records of ancient matters )
in the kojiki it is written as ' yomikoku ' ( the yomi country ) .
** it was believed that ancient japan had a path to yomi and was connected to ashihara naka no kuni ( fictional japan ) by yomotsuhirasaka ( slope of yomotsuhira ) .
this is also said to be the origin of the word " shimane " ( island-root ) .
yomotsuhirasaka is presumed to be equivalent to the town of higashiizumo , which is next to yasugi ) .
** izanami chased the fleeing izanagi as far as the sakamoto ( foot of the hill ) of yomotsuhirasaka ( some manuscripts record a different alternate version of this passage ) .
on she chased after his fleeing form , until they reached the foot of yomotsuhirasaka .
** consequently , it is possible to interpret this passage as claiming that izanagi ran down ( not up ) the yomotsuhirasaka .
therefore , the country of yomi was not always located underground in comparison to ashihara naka no kuni .
** more than a few academia believe that yomi country is located underground and this is accepted by the present day public .
however , the definition of the land of the dead being underground came from the chinese yomi and did not follow the original japanese thought .
** the chigaeshi no ookami is worshipped as the god that protects travelers everywhere around japan .
** but the biggest reason that izumo province was thought to be the location of yomi , the underworld , is that it was believed to be the place where the sun set on the japanese archipelago .
** this matched the folklore passed down in kiki concerning the southern sky of the kinai ( in and around the capital ) region .
** the sixth passage of the first volume of the " nihonshoki " reads , " a certain place is called " izumitsuhirasaka , " nor again is this separate from the existing places , but when the breath of people stops in death , is this its name ? "
** it is an accepted theory that this cave was ' inome dokutsu ' ( inome cave ) located at inome-cho , izumo city .
inome dokutsu was excavated in 0000 and human bodies and burial goods that ranged from yayoi period to tumulus period were discovered .
** commonly , chinese people called yomi as kosen ( chinese : huáng quán ) in chinese reading style .
** the ancient chinese believed that an underground world of the dead existed ; they called this world huangquan ( " yellow spring , " pronounced " yomi " or " kosen " in japanese ) .
the japanese kanji for " yo " ( 黄 ) in " yomi " ( 黄泉 ) symbolizes earth in the concept of the five elements and was used when describing things that were underground .
** yomi within the bible
such places were thought to be a sort of limbo , realms between heaven ( and hell ) and earth where the dead go to await the last judgment .
the following is yomi as portrayed in the bible .
** doso-shin ( japanese shinto deity )
** doso-shin ( also referred to as doso-jin ) is a deity on roadsides .
the deities are mostly deified in stone monuments or stone statues at village boundaries , city limits , crossroads , trifurcate roads , etc .
** these from the old era symbolize a pair of male and female .
the trace remains , for example , in steamed rice pounding , which symbolizes sexual intercourse .
they have been worshiped as a village guardian and fertility deity , and in recent times , a travel and traffic safety deity .
** although they have been spread nationwide , there are few of them in shimane prefecture where is the birthplace of the izumo myth .
they are popular in koshinetsu and kanto region .
** the word ' doso ' already appeared in a book from the heian period .
it became well-known for being written in the preface of basho matsuo ' s " narrow road to the deep north " .
however , basho himself showed no interest in the origin of doso-shin at all .
** although some say that it derived from chinese deity and jang-sung faith of the korean peninsula , its origin is unclear .
** when it was introduced to japan , it turned into the momodayu/hyakudayu faith as well as yin and yang stone faith , and then combined with the folk religion deity of chimata ( crossroads , highways and footpaths ) .
** moreover , was combined with sarutahiko-no-kami , also known as deity of a chimata , and his so-called wife amenouzumenomikoto in the shape of a male and female pair .
it was also combined with jizo bosatsu ( jizo bodhisattva ) in syncretization of shinto with buddhism .
accordingly , doso-shin has become fused to various faiths and religions from ancient to modern times .
** the letter ' 且 ' , which is a part of the character of ' 祖 ( so ) ' as in doso-shin indicates a penis in ancient chinese hieroglyphic characters left on bones and tortoise carapaces and kinbuntai ( chinese bronze inscriptions ) .
** in response to that , character of ' do ' may form female genitals in a letter type doso-shin statue .
** it is called by various names in various places .
for example , it may be called dorokujin , sai no kami , sae no kami , tamuke no kami , and so on .
around yuzawa city , akita prefecture , it is called " nio-san " .
** varieties and shapes

** remnants of koshinto that have survived to the present day , and the sacredness of hard work
** religious sects and changes among them
** koshinto was the ancient japanese religion which was the origin of shintoism and was called kodo , shintoism before 0th century .
** today ' s shinto and shrine shinto have incorporated koshinto to such a degree they are inseparable .
** koshinto is also termed a primitive religion , similar to those that sprang up naturally all over the world when people first formed into societies in the most ancient times .
japan ' s case , in which this sort of primitive religion survived the feudal and medieval periods and reached the modern period intact , is almost unique .
** kamiyo ( realm of the gods ) : the entire world , including this realm and tokoyo ( the spiritual realm ) .
** tokoyo

kami ( god )
** mikoto in japanese mythology refers to a god who takes the form of a human .
mitama refers to all gods except mikoto .
tamashii or " mitama " are terms used to describe the life ( force ) of human beings or their spiritual state .
god ' s mind
** an " arimitama " is a god who acts malevolently .
** nigimitama ( spirit of peace ) refers to the gentle god kannagi .
** shikon ( four spirits )
** a " kamiyo " or " kamishiro " is a place in this physical world where a god dwells .
it is called kamiyo ( 上代 ) or kamiyo ( 神世 ) when it is the era of god ruling the world before the era of emperor kanmu of japanese mythology .
** kannabi , kamunabi , or kaminabi ( which can all be written in various ways , with different chinese characters ) are terms that can be used to describe either a mountain where a god dwells or a forest in which a god lives hidden .
** " himorogi " delineates a forest or stand of trees in which a god lives hidden ; it can also refer to the borders of hallowed ground , or to the border with the tokoyo ( spirit realm ) .
today , it refers to the holy branches or leaves in which gods are thought to live , which are then used in rituals of shrine shinto .
** shintai ( lit . " god-body " ) , which have existed since ancient times , refer either to places gods are always present , to the gods ' bodies themselves , or to places or objects in which relatively large-sized traditional gods inhabit .
** mitamashiro , yorishiro , and shiro all refer to substitutes ( that can be honored in place of spirits or gods ) , and are used to describe all objects--except for those already mentioned--in which gods come to dwell temporarily .
** the word " fukannagi " has the same meaning as " kamioroshi " , or in other words , a person who can channel spirits and gods ( that is , a medium ) .
** today , if a person is not affiliated with any buddhist sect , s/he will have little opportunity to participate in urabon , which is why obon is thought to be a specifically buddhist festival .
** traditions concerning prayer and divination have been passed down to the modern-day shrine shinto , and there are still some shrines where tortoise-shell divination is still practiced at the new year , just as it was in ancient times .
today ' s omikuji ( fortune ) is a simplified version , made by the shinto priesthood , of the original prayers and divination .
** it is thought that many in ancient times , including himiko , were actually shamans who made political decisions about the course the country should take based on prayer or divination .
and so through their prayers and divinations , they were able to control the course of government policy .
this sort of decision-making model fell out of vogue and lay dormant starting in japan ' s warring states period , but remained in use among the court nobility and among shrine shinto .
** remnants of koshinto can still be seen today , many of which can be termed " folk belief " , but in fact koshinto is the very origin and essence of shrine shinto , and as such is inseparable from it .
this tradition of hard work has been passed down to the present day , and many companies today choose both to erect small shinto altars at their workplaces and to commemorate major turning points for the company with ceremonies featuring shinto rituals .
** there are two such sects , one whose form and style preserve the ancient ways and another which underwent a restoration beginning in the edo period .
** religious sects and changes among them
** beginning in the meiji period , koshinto--in contrast to state shinto , which was classified as a series of civil ceremonies and thus as different from other religions like buddhism or christianity--was marked by a much stronger sense of religiosity .
on this point , koshinto is very similar to late edo-period shinto sects , notably the kurozumikyo sect , and indeed , quite a few people choose to describe sect shinto ' s religious organizations as koshinto .
** kotoamatsukami
** table of emergence
** kotoamatsukami refers to the five deities that appeared at the creation according to the kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) .
** ame no minakanushi no kami
takamimushuhi no kami
kamimushuhi no kami
** then , the following two deities appeared , when the land was formed and became like a jellyfish floating in the sea .
these two deities also hid themselves as hitorigami .
** umashiashikabihikoji no kami
amenotokotachi no kami
** these five deities are called ' kotoamatsukami ' and are special even among amatsukami ( gods of heaven ) .
after kotoamatsukami , seven generations of the celestial gods appeared .
** kotoamatsukami , which because they came into the world during the earliest period , their divinity receive special treatment , and are supposed to surpass amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) .
this is indeed inconvenient for the emperors and therefore the imperial court , who want to authorize their own crown by regarding amaterasu omikami as the top god of takamanohara and claiming themselves as its descendants .
it ' s conceivable that kotoamatsukami were hidden in the process of editing kojiki and nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) in order to resolve this contradiction .
thus , they were considered to be " special , " but having no influence even though they exit .
** this is a table of emergence of each book .
they are in the order until the five deities are included in kojiki , and kuninotokotachi no mikoto ( eternal god of the land ) and the later deities are omitted .
** izanagi
** izanagi in myths
** the origin of his name
** shrines dedicaated to izanagi
** " izanagi " is a male god who appears in japanese mythology .
he is also called izanaki .
izanagi is referred to as izanagi no mikoto in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and as izanagi no kami in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
** he was married to izanami .
the description , ' imo ( which can mean a younger sister ) , izanami ' in kojiki sometimes leads to a misunderstanding that he was izanami ' s elder brother .
in this case , however , the word ' imo ' endearingly refers to a wife or a younger woman , which is interpreted as not meaning a younger sister in this context .
** although izanagi is the creator god of the national land , he has not been worshipped to any great extent in court rituals .
** he , together with izanami , was born at an event called " tenchi kaibyaku " ( creation of heaven and earth ( japanese mythology ) ) which created kaminoyonanayo ( seven generations of the gods ' world , the primordial seven ) , as the last generation .
in the myths about " kuniumi " ( the birth of the land of japan ) and " kamiumi " ( the birth of gods ) , he and izanami procreated many children who formed the land of japan .
** at the sight of her appalling figure , izanagi ran away from her .
he managed to shake off izanami , ikazuchi and yomotsu-shikome ( the ugly lady of yomi ) who tried to catch him , by throwing peach fruits ( to which he later gave the god name , okamuzumi no mikoto ) at them .
he divorced izanami by blocking her off with a big rock yomotsu hirasaka , the slope that leads to the land of the dead , at the exit of the earth .
** izanagi entrusted the three princes with reigns of takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , night and unabara ( sea ) respectively ,
but because susanoo did not stop crying insisting on going to hahanokuni nenokatasukuni ( the land where mother is , i . e . the land of the dead ) , izanagi cast him out .
according to nihonshoki , izanagi named the country ( now japan ) " urayasu . "
( urayasu city present and located in chiba prefecture was named after this . )
** there are various theories about what his name comes from , none of which has been well established .
** according to " jinno shotoki " ( a chronicle of gods and sovereigns ) written by chikafusa kitabatake around 0000 , the name izanagi came from the sanskrit words , ' ishanaten ' or ' ishanaku . '
** according to " kojikiden " ( commentaries on the kojiki ) written by norinaga motoori in 0000 , the part ' izana ' came from the japanese word ' izanau ( ( meaning " invite " ) and the remaining ' gi ' means a male .
** the name is also broken down into " iza " and " nagi " ( meaning calm ) to be interpreted as forming a pair with izanami of " iza " and " nami " ( meaning wave ) .
** izanagi-jingu shrine ( awaji city , hyogo prefecture ) :
according to nihonshoki , it is a kakurenomiya site ( where a god settled peacefully ) of izanagi no mikoto .
taga taisha shrine ( shiga prefecture ) :
according to kojiki , it is where izanagi no okami stays .
tsukiyominomiya of kotai-jingu shrine betsugu ( ise city , mie prefecture )
eda-jinja shrine ( miyazaki city , miyazaki prefecture ) :
it is where izanagi is said to have purified himself .
asashiro-jinja shrine ( maizuru city , kyoto prefecture )
mitsumine-jinja shrine ( chichibu city , saitama prefecture )
tsukubasan-jinja shrine ( tsukuba city , ibaraki prefecture )
kumano-jinja shrine ( kamezaki , yotsukaido city ) ( yotsukaido city , chiba prefecture )
** hiruko
** hiruko ( ohirukomuchi no mikoto , hiruko no kami , hiruko no mikoto ) is a god that appears in japanese mythology .
** descriptions in the mythology
" kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) describes that hiruko was the first god who was born between izanagi ( the male who invites ) and izanami ( the female who invites ) in kuni-umi ( the birth of ( the land ) of japan ) .
however , a goddess izanami sought sex , which caused the birth of the physically disabled god .
hiruko was put on a boat of reeds and carried offshore from onogoro island .
the mythology describes that the children of the two gods do not include hiruko and their second child , awashima no kami .
** folk stories and worship
there remain legends throughout japan that hinoko drifted ashore .
in many coastal regions in japan , something thrown up on the shore was worshiped as ebisu ( god of fishing and commerce ) .
hiruko began to be associated with and identified as equal to ebisu .
many shrines , for example in nishinomiya-jinja shrine ( nishinomiya city , hyogo prefecture ) , enshrine hiruko .
** the belief that hiruko is ebisu has been widely spread through kokinshu chukai ( apparatus criticus of the " kokinshu " ( collection of ancient and modern ) ) and other public entertainments .
the kanji for hiruko can be also read as ' ebisu , ' which shows that such a belief has been commonly held .
however , many shrines dedicated to ebisu regard ebisu as equal to kotoshiro no kami .
this is still a matter for further study , but feeling pity for hiruko who was carried off shore upon birth is considered to have created such a legend .
** origin
some suggest that the name came from a child like hiru ( an animal ) and others suggested that it means " hinoko " ( a child of the sun ) .
** there are myths all over the world that the first child of a couple of the originators- a god and a goddess--were handicapped .
** some interpret hinoko as ' a child of the sun ' because " ru " is archaic form of " no " in modern japanese .
others interpret hiru as a time zone filled with spirits of daytime , because " ru " refers to spirits .
** if the interpretation of ' a child of the sun ' is chosen , hinoko can be regarded as a god of the sun .
some myths about the sun in the world say that the sun is carried on a boat .
in addition , some interpret ohirumenomuchi no kami--another name of its sister amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) --as ' a daughter of the sun ' to connect the gods .
** the kanji for " me " in ' hirume ' was a character newly created by the compiler of " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
the character was formed by removing " 巫 " from kanji " 靈 " and adding " 女 . "
the character " 巫 " is used only to represent kannagi ( female spiritual medium ) .
some scholars are solving a secret of amaterasu omikami by focusing on why the new kanji was created so far by replacing " 女 " and what it had to express .
** paying attention to their existence as a couple , some have an opinion that gods of the sun , originally a couple , were later sycretized with miko ( a shrine maiden ) who served them and enshrined together .
** kagutsuchi
** kagutsuchi is the god of fire that appears in kiki-shinwa ( the kojiki , nihonshoki and mythology ) .
kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) describes it as hinoyagihayao no kami , hinokakabiko no kami , or hinokagutsuchi no kami .
nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) also describes it as kagutsuchi or homusubi .
** description in mythologies
kagutsuchi is a god born between izanagi and izanami .
because kagutsuchi was a god of fire , izanami suffered a burn on her pubic region in giving birth .
this resulted in her death .
furious at this , izanagi then killed kagutsuchi with totsuka no tsurugi ( the sword ten hands long ) called ' amenoohabari . '
** according to kojiki , many gods were born from its blood , which are listed below .
** iwasaku no kami
nesaku no kami
iwatsutsu no okami
the three gods above were created when the blood dropped from the distal tip of totsuka no tsurugi on a rock .
** mikahayahi no kami
hihayahi no kami
takemikazuchi no onokami
it is also known as takefutsu no kami or toyofutsu no kami .
these three gods were created when the blood dropped from the root of totsuka no tsurugi on a rock .
** kuraokami no kami
kuramitsuha no kami
these two gods were created when the blood dropped from the handle of totsuka no tsurugi on a rock .
** in addition , the following gods were born out of the body of kagutsuchi .
** masakayamatsumi no kami ( born from the head of kagutsuchi )
odoyamatsumi no kami ( born from the chest of kagutsuchi )
okuyamatsumi no kami ( born from the belly of kagutsuchi )
kurayamatsumi no kami ( born from the sexual organ of kagutsuchi )
shigiyamatsumi no kami ( born from the left hand of kagutsuchi )
hayamatsumi no kami ( born from the right hand of kagutsuchi )
harayamatsumi no kami ( born from the left foot of kagutsuchi )
toyamatsumi no kami ( born from the right foot of kagutsuchi )
** gods ' names
hinoyagihayao no kami
" hi-no " literally means that the god is a god of fire .
" yagi " can be interpreted as ' yaku ' ( burn ) in the modern japanese .
however , it is more appropriate to interpret it as ' the god burning by itself emitting fire ' in ancient japanese .
" haya " was used as a prefix to nouns to show emphasis in ancient japanese .
" onokami " literally means that the god is a male divine .
** in short , hinoyagihayao no kami means ' the male god of fire that is burning . '
** hinokakabiko no kami
" kaka " is equal to ' kagayaku ' ( shining ) in modern japanese .
here it means ' a fire is giving out a light . '
" biko " is a word equal to " 彦 , " which shows that the god is a male deity .
** in short , hinokakabiko no kami means ' the male god of fire which is shining . '
** hinokagutsuchi no kami
" kagu " is equal to ' kaka , ' which means ' shining . '
the way " kagu " represents " shining " remains today for example in words such as ' kaguya hime ' ( lady kaguya ) .
" kagu " has a relation with words in modern language such as ' nioi-wo-kagu ' ( smell ) and ' kaguwashii ' ( fragrant ) .
some suggest that " kagu " here means that ' it carries the smell of something is burning . '
" tsuchi " can be divided into ' tsu ' and ' chi . '
an archaic word , ' tsu ' corresponds to a modern word of ' no ' used , for example , when we say ' watashi no hon ' ( my book ) .
in addition , ' chi ' is a word that represents supernatural beings such as gods .
** in short , hinokagutsuchi no kami means ' a god of fire that is shining ' or it can be regarded as ' a god of fire that carries the smell of something burning . '
** worship
some suggest that odaki-jinja shrine in yasuki city , shimane prefecture has also something to do with this god .
** takemikazuchi
** takemikazuchi is a god that appears in japanese mythology .
** it is written as " 建御雷之男神 " or " 建御雷神 " in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) , and as " 武甕槌 " or " 武甕雷男神 " in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
it may be written simply as " 建雷命 . "
it is also known as takefutsu no kami , or toyofutsu no kami .
in addition , it is also called kashima no kami , because it is enshrined in kashima-jingu shrine ( kashima city , ibaraki prefecture ) .
** descriptions in kojiki
in kamiumi ( bearing gods between izanagi and izanami ) , takemikazuchi was one of the three gods created out of the blood scattered on a rock from the root of totsuka no tsurugi called ' amenoohabari ' when izanagi beheaded kagutsuchi ( the kami of fire ) .
in the narrative of japanese mythology called " ashihara no nakatsukuni heitei " ( pacification of ashihara no nakatsukuni ) , it was described as a child of itsunoohabari , which is also known as amenoohabari .
** sumo is said to come from the fight with takeminakata no kami .
** explanations
the word , ' mikazuchi ' included in the name refers to lightening and raijin ( god of lightning ) is also a god of a sword .
although the god is also known as futsugami , it was originally different .
according to " nihonshoki , " it was futsunushi no kami that descended with takemikazuchi to ashihara no nakatsukuni .
futsunushi is a god enshrined in katori-jingu shrine .
** originally it was a god indigenous to kashima and worshiped as a god of marine traffic .
kashima became an important region for yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) to debouch into the east .
in addition , the nakatomi clan in charge of religious services had long placed their faith in kashima no kami , takemikazuchi , because it came from joso region that covers kashima .
therefore takemikazuchi became an important god for yamato sovereignty .
** worship
** soja
** soja refers to a shrine that has collected gods of local shrines and enshrined them together .
some shrines were those put together in a ryoseikoku ( province ) , and others were those in a private estate or village .
other were those in a gun ( district ) or a go ( region ) .
** summary
soja in province
in ancient japan , the first task of kokushi ( provincial governors ) was to visit and worship at all the shrines within the province .
during the heian period , establishing a soja near the kokufu ( provincial office ) and worshiping at it became wide spread to save the tour of every shrine .
this is why the soja was generally located near the kokufu .
a large number of soja once disappeared in the medieval period and some revived later .
others have not revived yet or no body knows which used to be soja .
** amatsukami and kunitsukami
** amatsukami ( 天津神 ; gods of heaven ) and kunitsukami ( 国津神 ; gods of the land ) are the grouping of gods ( shinto ) that appear in japanese mythology .
** summary
amatsukami is a general term for gods that are in takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) or have descended to this world , whereas kunitsukami is a general term for gods that have appeared on the land .
** in japanese mythology , most kunitsukami are regarded as those dominated by amatsukami .
it is considered that gods worshiped by people in regions conquered by the yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) were grouped as kunitsukami and gods worshiped by imperial family and influential clans as amatsukami .
in particular , many kunitsukami were transformed when included in japanese mythology ; many of their folk stories no longer remain .
since nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) often described that those sentences were quoted from folk stories orally handed down , written records of such stories seem to have been lost .
** because , ' tsu ' corresponds to ' no ' in modern japanese , amatsukami and kunitsukami means gods of heaven and gods of the land respectively .
they may be described as ' 天つ神 ' ( amatsukami ) and ' 国つ神 ' ( kunitsukami ) .
amatsukami is called as ' tenjin ' ( 天神 ) and kunitsukami as ' chiji , ' ( 地神 ) written with two chinese characters .
they are collectively called ' tenjinchigi ' or ' jingi . '
** nigihayahi
** summary
** other names of amenohoakari
** nigihayahi no mikoto is a god ( shinto ) who appears in japanese mythology .
it is written " 饒速日命 " in the " nihonshoki " ( the chronicles of japan ) , and " 邇藝速日命 " in the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) .
** in the jinmu tosei ( the eastern expedition of the emperor jinmu ) in the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , nigihayahi no mikoto appears as a deity enshrined by nagatsunehiko , who was a powerful local clan in the region of yamato province .
he made tomiyasubime , a younger sister of nagasunehiko , his wife and they had a boy , umashimaji no mikoto .
umashimaji no mikoto was regarded as the ancestor of the mononobe clan , the hozumi clan and the uneme clan .
in the eastern expedition of iwarebiko ( the future emperor jinmu ) , nagatsunehiko fought iwarebiko but was defeated .
and afterward , nigihayahi no mikoto submitted himself to iwarebiko because he found out that iwarebiko was the descendant of amaterasu .
** then he seemed to move to yamato province ( nara prefecture ) .
the above story was considered to come from a different source , not from the legend of " tensonkorin " ( descent to earth of ninigi , who was a descendant of the sun goddess ) .
nigihayahi no mikoto has been regarded as an ancestor deity of the powerful clans , especially of the mononobe clan , who was in charge of saishi ( religious services ) while the japanese mythology clearly mentions that he was settled in yamato province prior to the emperor jinmu .
this means , the existence of nigihayahi implies many important subjects .
there is a theory that sovereign power by izumo family already existed in yamato province before the emperor jinmu .
there are also other theories , such as , that the mononobe clan was tied up politically in the region of yamato .
** other names

amateru kuniteruhiko hoakari

although some people consider that there are many academic problems with his theory , others think it evokes a sense of romanticism to the ancient history , inspiring quite a few writers .

** ugayafukiaezu
** faith
** ugayafukiaezu is a deity in japanese mythology .
** myths
he was the son of hoori ( yamasachihiko ) , his father , and toyotamabime , his mother who was the daughter of watatsumi no kami ( the sea god ) .
three generations of deities , including ninigi , hoori , and ugayafukiaezu , are called himuka sandai or hyuga sandai .
** although she tried to make a shelter on the beach , she went into labor before she could completely thatch the roof with waterfowl feathers which she used instead of the usual grass .
hence the newborn baby was named ' ugaya fuki aezu , ' which literally means being unable to ' finish thatching the roof with waterfowl feathers ' .
toyotamabime said to hoori , her husband , that women from different countries turned into their real selves when giving birth .
she told her husband not to look into her maternity room as she wanted to assume her real self to deliver her baby .
despite her plea , hoori peeked in her room only to see a giant alligator , her true self , crawling around .
he ran away .
ashamed of being seen by her husband toyotamabime went back to the sea , leaving her newborn baby behind .
then , she sent her younger sister , tamayoribime , in her place .
although toyotamabime was angry with hoori for having peeked into her delivery room , she still felt great affection for him .
she exchanged poems with him through tamayoribime .
** mikenu went over to tokoyo ( lit . " the normal world , " though some texts hint that it is the afterworld ) , while inahi went to the ocean where his mother resided .
his youngest child , wakamikenu , who later became kamu yamato ihare biko , was emperor jinmu , the first emperor of japan .
** comments on this story
one gets married to someone of a different species and is told that a particular action is taboo , but the taboo is broken and the true self of the partner is revealed .
the couple are forced to separate .
stories of this type are common all over the world .
they are often found in japanese mythology as well , ( as seen in tales of visiting yomi , a world after death , to give birth to a deity ) .
the grateful crane , a folktale , also has a similar plot .
amongst them , the offspring of children who were born from the parents of different species are often described as the earliest ancestors of the imperial family and noble clans .
** all the deities that are connected to emperors , except for the deity ugayafukiaezu , have names related to the ' rice plant . '
many scholars hold different theories on the reason for this .
some say that ugayafukiaezu might have been a deity created at a later time as there have been few descriptions of his deeds and achievements .
they consider that ugayafukiaezu , a deity who combines the power of mountains and the sea , might have served as a symbol of the emperor who ruled everything , from mountains to the ocean .
** some say that ugayafukiaezu is the same as tentsushi , who appeared in a tale of yashiro-go ( yasugi city , shimane prefecture ) in izumo no kuni fudoki ( the topography of izumo province ) .
** like other deities connected to emperors , ugayafukiaezu is worshipped as a deity of agriculture .
because of the tale mentioned earlier , ugayafukiaezu has also been prayed to as a deity to whom people pray for matrimonial harmony and safe childbirth .
ugayafukiaezu is enshrined in udo-jingu shrine ( nichinan city , miyazaki prefecture ) and miyazaki-jingu shrine ( miyazaki city ) .
** according to the nihonshoki , ugayafukiaezu was buried in a placed called ' aira no yamanoue no misasagi ' ( literally , imperial tomb at the top of mt . aira ) .
however , there are many places in southern kyushu that have been believed to be the burial place of ugayafukiaezu .
in 0000 , the meiji government determined that his tomb is located in kanoya city kagoshima prefecture ( formerly aira-cho , kimotsuki-gun ) , based on the opinions of the scholars of the defunct satsuma domain .
( the government also identified tombs in kagoshima prefecture as those of the other himuka sandai deities . )
however , as opposition to this decision came from people in hyuga a survey was conducted by the scholars of ancient japanese literature and culture and the imperial household agency .
in 0000 , a decision was finally made on this issue that the top of mt . hayahi-no-mine , which is located behind udo-jingu shrine , is the legendary place of ' aira no yamanoue no misasagi , ' the tomb of ugayafukiaezu .
there are some scholars who still insist that the tomb is located in ' aria no yamane no misusage ' in takachiho town , nishi usuki county , miyazaki prefecture .
** amenooshihomimi
** amenooshihomimi ( masakatsuakatsu kachihayahi amenooshihomimi ) is a god ( shinto ) that appeared in japanese mythology .
** it is also written that he was a son of amaterasu who had a monozane ( medium to produce something ) .
he had children , amenohoakari and ninigi , with takamimusubi ' s daughter , takuhatachijihime no mikoto .
** when ashihara no nakatsukuni ( literally , " central land of reed plains , " which refers to the human world ) was pacified , he was ordered by amaterasu to come down from the celestial world and govern it .
however he turned back halfway saying the human world was too dangerous .
but he suggested that his son , ninigi , who was born during that time would go there , therefore ninigi went down ( this occurrence is called tensonkorin ) .
** the word , ' oshiho ' means many ears of rice , and this indicates he is a deity of rice ears .
** ninigi
** ninigi ( amenigishi kuninigishi amatsuhiko hiko hononinigi ) is a deity in japanese mythology .
generally , he is called " ninigi no mikoto " ( spelled as " 瓊瓊杵尊 " or " 瓊々杵尊 " ) .
** mythology
he was a son of oshihomimi , a son of amaterasu ( the sun goddess ) , and takuhatachijihime no mikoto ( also called " yorozuhatatoyoakitsushihime no mikoto " ) , a daughter of takamimusubi .
ame no hoakari was his elder brother .
according to a different theory cited in the nihonshoki , ninigi was a son of the deity ame no hoakari .
** this is called tensonkorin ( the sun goddess ' s grandson ' s descent to earth ) .
according to the kojiki , ninigi ' descended from heaven at kujifurutake , kakaho in hyuga , tsukushi . '
in nihonshoki , he is said to have descended from heave at the ' himuka no so no takachiho no mine ' ( literally , the peak of takachiho in himuka ) or ' tsukushi no himuka no takachiho ' ( literally , takachiho , himuka , tsukushi ) .
** many scholars agree that ninigi , who descended to the peak of takachiho in hyuga province , eventually reached kasasa no misaki in nagaya in ata province ( currently minami-satsuma city ) .
** ninigi married konohanano sakuya bime , the daughter of the deity oyamatsumi , and had three sons : hoderi ( umisachi , literally , " sea treasures " ) , hosuseri , and hoori ( yamasachi , literally , " mountain products " ) .
the grandson of hoori is emperor jinmu , the first emperor of japan .
when he died , he was buried in ' enoyama no misasagi ' ( literally , ' imperial tomb in mt . eno ' ) .
** comments
part of his name , ' ame nigishi kuni nigishi , ' means that heaven and earth are affluent and lively .
amatsuhiko ' means the deities amatsukami and ' hiko ' means male .
hono ninigi ' means a good rice harvest .
ninigi ' means ' lively ' and has the same root as ' nigiyaka , ' which means ' bustling or busy . '
deities such as ame no oshihomimi no mikoto , hoderi , hosuseri , and hoori mentioned earlier , who are considered to be ninigi ' s relatives in mythology , commonly contain the sound of ' ho ' in their names .
ho ' signifies rice .
** although there are several sites in southern kyushu that are believed to be ' hyuga no enoyama no misasagi , ' ninigi ' s burial place , the imperial household agency has officially declared that ninigi was buried in nitta-jinja shrine in satsumasendai city .
nitta-jinja shrine came under the direct control of the imperial household agency in 0000 ,
the imperial tomb precinct covers four fifths of mt . shinki , where the shrine is located .
currently , the eno division of the momoyama regional office , archives and mausolea department of the imperial household agency is located within the precinct of the shrine and an official of the cabinet office administers the tomb as a guardian .
imperial tombs that are part of a shinto shrine are rare .
this imperial family have visited the shrine on nine occasions .

while amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) symbolizes the sky , okuninushi symbolizes the earth .
** okuninushi is called by many different names .
it is always explained in terms of the virtue of okuninushi , but it is also attributed to the fact that okuninushi is a result of integrating different gods .
** okuninushi no kami means an emperor that governs a large country or the lord of ou .
therefore , there has been a theory that okuninushi no kami was the lord of ou ( an area in the eastern part of izumo province ) .
** these are the names used by the young okuninushi .
** onamuchi no mikoto :

** according to the main body of " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , okuninushi was a son of susanoo ( a deity in japanese mythology ) .
** taking over the work of susanoo , okuninushi worked with sukunabikona to control the country , taught kinen ( incantations ) and medicine , and completed the creation of ashihara no nakatsukuni ( a word to express the country or a location in japan ) .

** okuninushi and many different goddesses had many children .
okuninushi had 000 child gods according to kojiki and 000 according to nihonshoki .
** none of the mythologies above mentioned suseri-bime , who was a daughter of susanoo and okuninushi ' s legal wife .
** kinomata no kami was born to okuninushi and his first wife , yagami-hime .
** ajisukitakahikone ( kamo no okami ) and taka-hime ( shitateru-hime ) were born to okuninushi and takiri-bime , who was one of the munakata sanjojin ( three goddesses enshrined at munakata taisha shrine ) .

** ayato-hime from uka-go , izumo-gun , rejected okuninushi ' s love .
** okuninushi has been worshipped as a god of building nations , agriculture , commerce , and medicine .
also , because the first two chinese characters of okuninushi can also be pronounced as ' daikoku ' okuninushi has been syncretized with daikokuten ( mahakala or daikoku-sama ) that shares that pronunciation and has been accepted in the beliefs of the common people .
because kotoshironushi no kami , who was a child of okuninushi , has been syncretized with ebisu , daikoku-sama and ebisu came to be believed as being a parent and a child .

** omononushi
** omononushi is a deity in japanese mythology .
the deity omononushi is enshrined in omiwa-jinja shrine .
in " izumo kokuso kamuyogoto " ( ritual greetings by the highest priest of izumo taisha shrine to the emperor ) , he is mentioned as omononushi kushimikatama .
the deity enshrined in omiwa-jinja shrine is considered to be the peaceful spirit of onamochi ( okuninushi ) .
he is also called " miwa-myojin . "
** okuninushi was at loss about what to do next to build the country .
then , he saw a shining deity coming from beyond the sea and the deity wanted okuninushi to enshrine him in mt . miwa in yamato province .
who are you , ' asked okuninushi .
i am your saki mitama ( soul that makes people happy by luck ) and your kushi mitama ( a soul that makes people happy with miracles ) , ' he answered .
according to an opinion cited in nihonshoki , okuninushi no kami is also referred to as saki mitama or kushi mitama .
the history of omiwa-jinja shrine says that okuninushi no kami enshrined his own nikimitama as omononushi-no-mikoto .
** having heard people say that seyadatarahime , the daughter of mishima no mizokui , was a beauty , omononushi who fell in love with her at first sight .
wanting to talk to her somehow , he turned himself into a red arrow and waited .
when he saw her coming to a river to relieve herself the arrow started to flow down the stream .
when it came beneath her , it stuck into her nether regions .
when she brought the arrow back to her room , it changed back into omononushi , and then they made love .
this was how himetataraisuzu hime ( isukeyori hime ) , the future empress of emperor jinmu , came into being .
** suddenly , there appeared a handsome man in front of ikutamayori bime , a daughter of suetsumimi no mikoto , and they made love .
to her dismay , she soon became pregnant .
worrying about her , her parents questioned her about what had happened .
at last , she confessed that she had a handsome man coming to her every night although she did not know who he was .
anxious to know who he was , her parents told her to get a linen thread on a spool through a needle and to attach it to the hem of his garment .
next morning , peering through a keyhole , they saw the tread going out extending all the way to a shrine on mt . miwa as they tracked it .
as there were only three rolls ( " miwa , " literally " three rings " ) of thread left on the spool , the place where the other end of the thread was found got the name of ' miwa . '
** on the other hand , omononushi told emperor sujin to have ootataneko enshrine him .
this is how today ' s omiwa-jinja shrine was built .
** omononushi has many characters ; he is a hebigami ( god of snakes ) , suijin ( god of water ) , and raijin ( god of lightning ) .
he has been worshipped by people who pray for good rice harvest , the warding off of evil , and the protection of the sake brewing business .
he is believed to be a guardian of this country , but at the same time , to have the power to curse people .
** in haibutsukisyaku ( the anti-buddhism movement ) , that started in the first year of the meiji period , many temples adopted omononushi-no-mikoto as their enshrined deity , replacing their honzon ( the principle image of buddha ) that had been worshipped for a long time .
** an example of this was kotohira-gu shrine in kotohira-cho , nakatado-gun , kagawa prefecture .
kotohira-gu , which had been a temple , became a shinto shrine , replacing kubira taisho , one of juni shinsho ( twelve heavenly generals of yakushi buddha ) , worshipped as the principle image , with omononushi no mikoto .
however , many reforms carried out by the meiji government , whose policy revolved around the restoration of imperial rule , conformed to the ancient records of registered shinto shrines .
in general , a shift from buddha to shinto deities of izumo ( the heartland of japanese mythology ) took place in a systematic way .
** susano
** shrines of shusaijin ( main enshrined deities )
** former kankoku heisha ( general term for kanpeisha and kokuheisha , which were the high-ranking shrines ) and shrines in the appendix
** shrines distributed across the country
** susano ( also known as susano no mikoto ) was a deity ( shinto religion ) that appeared in japanese mythology .
he was sometimes seen identical to gozu tenno ( a deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) .
he was the youngest son of mihashira no uzuno miko ( three deities ) .
his given role was little different from that of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) , who deified the sun , and tsukuyomi , who deified the moon , so it has been the topic of debate .
** description in mythology
** it was described in " nihon shoki " that he was born between izanagi and izanami ( the female who invites ) .
** according to " kojiki , " susano refused it but instead wanted to go to nenokuni ( land of the roots ) , where the mother goddess izanami stayed , but izanagi was angered by that and expelled him from the land .
his name was cleared by pleading his faith , so susano remained in takamanohara ; but he behaved badly there and amaterasu omikami hid in ama no iwato ( cave of heaven ) .
therefore , susano was expelled from takamanohara and went down to ashihara no nakatsukuni .
** susano went to suga-jinja shrine in izumo by taking kushinadahime as his wife , who was about to be eaten by yamatanoorochi .
he then composed a poem , ' clouds covered the eightfold fence ; making the eightfold fence to keep my new wife in the house ; great eightfold fence . '
from that , ' yakumo ' became the word that symbolized izumo .
susano had his wife give birth to okuninushi ( chief god of izumo in southern honshu island , japan , and the central character in the important myths of that region ) ( called oanamuchi no kami in " nihon shoki " ) .
in " kojiki , " okuninushi no mikoto was a descendant after the sixth generation of susano , and eventually he went to nenokuni ( underworld ) .
** in the fourth section of the first book , which described yamatanoorochi in " nihon shoki , " susano , who had been expelled from takamanohara , went down to soshimari ( shoshimori ) in shiragi .
** in the mythology of okuninushi , onamuji ( okuninushi ) , who came to susano in nenokuni ( the underworld ) , fell in love with suseri-bime , susano ' s daughter , at first sight , but susano set various trials before onamuji .
onamuji overcame those trials and susano accepted onamuji ' s right to take suseri-bime as his wife , whereupon he gave onamuji the name of okuninushi .
** explanation
susano had many faces .
on one hand , he could scream like a child in order to go to his mother ' s land , but he also showed a brutish side in takamanohara .
when he came down to izumo , he suddenly changed to the hero character of kishuryuri-tan ( a type of folktale in which a character such as a young deity or nobility overcomes trials in order to be a god or be blessed ) .
susano showed a cultivated side , composing the first waka in japan and utilizing trees for woodcraft or architecture .
some say that this was because susano was created by an amalgamation of many gods , and other theories suggest this was a side of susano that appeared as he grew .
** therefore , some say he might have originally been a god in another area , and the possible areas are as follows .
** there is a theory that it might be bitchu province , where yamatanoorochi was exterminated , as described in nihon shoki .
it might be kii province since okuninushi went to ' kinokuni ' ( land of trees ) before he went to susano in nenokuni and his son isotakeru was enshrined .
there is a theory that it might be shiragi , since it was written in the fourth section of the first book in nihon shoki that he first went down to soshimori in shiragi and then came to torigami no mine in izumo .
however , it could be said that he basically developed strong ties with izumo by looking at the historical records called kiki and fudoki .
these areas had developed the tatara iron-making method in ancient times , and it was widely thought that this meant that susano established his rule over the iron-making group by slaying yamata no orochi .
based on comparative mythology , the mythology of obtaining iron and a sword by exterminating a monster is thought to be a metaphor for the establishment of a nation .
there are various theories as to why susano was thought to be a younger brother of amaterasu and an important god .
** later , he became combined with gozu tenno ( a deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) , who was a guardian god of jetavana vihara under buddhism .
it was because both gods delivered disasters and epidemics .
** both tsukuyomi and susano were deities of the ocean and this myth was a legacy of the jomon period .
voyagers sailing in the sea calculated the time by the night moon and prayed to the ocean deities , wishing for favorable winds .
** however over time , as the seafarers memories became vague along with the boundaries of governing regions , these deities became separate entities .

** sukunabikona
** main shrines dedicated to sukunabikona
** sukunabikona ( also called sukunahikona , as well as sukunaminokami , sukunahikona , sukunahikone , and so on ) is a god in the japanese mythology .
** he is a god who came on the amenokagami-no-fune ship when okuninushi was creating the nation .
he is described in various ways , for example as a god who cooperated in creation of the nation , an everlasting god , medicine , stone , or the spirit of the grain .
however likening to liquor and stone is merely an imagination from descriptions and refers only to his nature .
** according to " kojiki , " sukunabikona came on amenokagami-no-fune ship from between waves when okuninushi was creating the nation and participated in the creation by order of onamuchi no okami .
similar description is found in " nihonshoki " and he rarely appears in other literature than " kojiki " and " nihonshoki . "
while he has various aspects of a creator of nations , he is likened to have a personality like that of a naughty child ( from the 0th alternate writing of section 0 in nihonshoki ) .
like onamuchi , sukunabikona appears as a creator of many mountains and hills as well as a god of names .
he later leaves to tokoyo no kuni ( parallel universe beyond the sea ) .
** seiichi kanai says the name means ' an imperial son in his youth . '
as this god never acts alone but is always with onamuchi , there are age-old arguments over the relations between these two gods .
taryo obayashi finds ' the second self ' and atsuhiko yoshida points out a twin-like relation .
in japan there is a belief from old ages that the pure land is over the sea or in the bottom of sea and all the wealth and wisdom and life come from there .
this is a legend originating from experiences from the jomon period and it is said sukunabikona has the same origin .

** toyouke-bime
** toyouke-bime is one of the gods from japanese mythology .
she is known as toyouke no okami who is enshrined in toyouke dai-jingu shrine ( outer shrine of ise ) .
she is represented as toyoukebime no kami ( 豊宇気毘売神 ) in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) and toyoukehime no kami ( 豊受媛神 ) in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
she is also called toyuuke no kami , omonoimi no kami , toyooka-hime , yafune toyoukehime no mikoto , toyuke okami , toyouka no menokami , toyohirume etc .
** the word , ' uke ' in shinmyo ( name of the god ) means a food , and she is a female god who controls food and grain .
later toyouke-bime together with other shokumotsu-shin such as ogetsu-hime ( the food-goddess ) and ukemochi no kami ( goddess who possesses food ) were combined with inari-shin ( the god of harvest ) ( ukano mitama ) , and those were thought to be identical .
** therefore , toyouke no okami was transferred from tanba province to watarai , ise province .
that means she was originally the god of tanba province .
** tangono kuni fudoki itsubun , a lost writing of regional gazetteer for tango province carries the following story as an engi ( writing about the history ) of nagu-no-yashiro shrine :
eight heavenly maidens were bathing at hinuma-no-manai of hiji-no-sato , tanba-no-kori , and one of the heavenly maidens was unable to return home because an elderly couple hid hagoromo ( a feathered robe ) .
therefore the heavenly maiden lived in the elderly couple ' s house .
after 00 years , however , she was driven out of the house , drifted from place to place , and then settled down in minagu-mura .
this heavenly maiden is considered to be toyoukebime no kami .
** settsu-no kuni fudoki itsubun , a lost writing of regional gazetteer for settsu province says that toyouka no menokami had lived in mt . inakura , settsu province ( not known where it is ) before transferred to tanba province .
a shrine where aramitama ( god ' s rough soul ) of toyouke no okami is enshrined is called takanomiya ( either 多賀宮 or 高宮 ) .
** ise shinto also thinks that geku is in a higher position than naiku ( inner shrine ) because the toyouke no okami is enshrined at geku .
in " yamatokatsuragihozan-ki " which had a great impact on establishment of chusei nihongi ( medieval nihongi ) such as shito gobusho ( five-volume apologia of shinto ) , the document which backs up the legend of toyouke no okami came from katsuragi .
on august 000 , she was transferred from tanba province to yamada , ise province .
** however , kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) does not say anything about it .
nihonshoki says that on august 000 , uranoshimako ( urashimataro ) left for the palace of the dragon king .
it is worth noting that nihonshoki puts the chinese style story which is thought to be a fiction ahead of the transfer of enshrined deity to geku which was related to an important national religious service .
in addition , chinese style legends of feathered robes were told around this region .
there is intent to try to change the divinity of the deity enshrined in geku including the story that makes it sound as if toyouke no okami were one of the hagoromo heavenly maiden sisters .
** this is considered to be the first time this region was called taniwa ( 田庭 ) .
then , there is a theory that taniwa ( 田庭 ) was later changed to taba ( 田場 ) and then tanba ( 丹波 ) , and this way the name of place tanba ( 丹波 ) or tajima ( 但馬 ) was started .
there was once an old and large rice nursery in bogaki , tottori city which had a crescent shaped rice nursery too .
this originated in an event where inaba-daimyojin initiated rice cultivation and the nearby inaba-jinja shrine enshrines inaba-daimyojin .
this event probably represents toyouke no okami ' s descent to this region .
that is , it can be said the name of the place inaba ( 稲葉 , 稲場 , or 因幡 ) derives from those related to toyouke no okami .
tsukinowaden was moved from the original location and reduced because of farm field development conducted in the showa period .
** in the near future , tsukinowaden is needed to be restored to its original size because of its great significance .
there is okami no mori and hoi-no-dan which is considered to be the site of ame-no-manai about half way up the nearby mt . kuji-dake .
also rectangular parallelepiped iwakura called omiaeishi remains , and this is considered the origin of the shrine .
manai-jinja shrine in amanohashidate is positioned linearly with the top of the mt . kuji-dake , omiaeishi , the precincts of hinumanai-jinja shrine , and omiyame-jinja shrine , and it is likely to be linked .
** oe-cho , fukuchiyama city , kyoto prefecture has motoise toyuke-daijinja shrine .
this shrine is located in mt . funaoka in the south of motoise naiku shrine , and kawada clan which was derived from the fujiwara clan succeed its shinto priesthood for generations .
according to the documents that have been handed down in kawada clan , sengu ( transfer of a deity to a new shrine building ) seems to have been carried out once a every 00 years or so since heian period .
in that sense , it can be a shrine of rather high status .
** during the reign of emperor sujin , when toyosukiiri-hime moved all over the country as a mitsueshiro ( divine spirit staff ) of amaterasu omikami , the first place she transferred to was tango .
several presumed locations exist but if motoise naiku shrine is the exact place , the meaning of toyuke-daijinja shrine becomes clear .
more specifically , there is a theory that this place may be the location where the divine spirit of toyouke no okami appeared when toyosukiiri-hime was once transferred to tango .
** some inari-jinja shrine enshrine both inari-shin ( the god of harvest ) and toyouke-bime .
** norito ( shinto prayer )
** comment
** " 祝詞 "
norito '
norito is a shinto ritual .
the detailed explanation is given below .
** shukushi '
the word ' shukushi ' refers to congratulations .
in many cases , it is a euphemism for a speech at celebrations .
** norito refers to shinto prayers , through which people pay tribute to the virtue of gods and show their reverence for deities , with the intention of asking gods for blessing and of fulfilling their wishes .
in general , norito are chanted by shinto priests in a special intonation , and norito are characterized by their unique writing style , diction , and fonts .
** the belief that the word ' norito ' comes from the word ' noritogoto ' seems to have been the most popular one until recently .
** in ancient times , ' noritogoto ' also referred to the words presented by gods to people who assembled at a religious service ( " senmei-tai , " or a grand style written in an imperial-edict manner ) .
because the prefix ' nori ' in ' norito ' can have connotations of declarations to subordinates , it is possible to assume that the senmei-tai style norito can be the quintessence of norito .
** in other words , it can be assumed that prayers that belonged to the so-called yogoto ( tribute ) genre by orikuchi ' s definition happened to be called ' norito . '
even today , it is not easy to decide which one of the above-mentioned two theories about the origin and meanings of the word ' norito ' is closer to the truth .
** those pieces are priceless documents that can date back to the time prior to the nara period and important documents that can communicates the world of ancient norito to modern people .
the following are 00 pieces of norito printed in the " engishiki "
** kinensai ( prayer service for a good crop )

pieces 0 to 0 are norito for rites and festivals held by each shrine while pieces 0 to 00 for court rituals and piece 00 for ise-jingu shrine ; pieced 00 to 00 are supplemental prayers .
this suggests that the origins and forms of the latter were different from those of the former .
** depending on the purpose , there are a variety of norito , and even today , the so-called " yamato kotoba " ( the ancient or primordial japanese language ) has been used for norito .
the same norito is also used for ' harae kotoba , ' words read by the priest in " shubatsu " ( a shinto purification rite ) implemented before rites and festivals , and for ' oharae no kotoba , ' words used for oharae .
** today , many norito samples and templates are available .
it is all right to use samples as a reference when creating norito , but some critics point out that too much dependence on samples and templates can lead to fixed expressions of norito , which misses the original objectives of norito .
** when a shinto priest chants norito ( at shinto shrines under the umbrella of the association of shinto shrines ) , he takes a seat and bows twice before chanting norito and bows twice and clap hands twice ( shinto ) and bow once after chanting them .
of course , this is not the only allowable etiquette .
** okutsuki
** the word ' okutsuki ' refers to tombs of ancient times .
the word also refers to shinto-style graves .
okutsuki sometimes means letters inscribed on shinto-style headstones
it can also be spelled as ' 奥津城 , ' or ' 奥城 . '
** the word ' 都 ' is used for the graves of shinto priests and parishioners whereas the word ' 津 ' is used for the graves of laypersons .
however , if laypersons have ancestors who were shinto priests or parishioners , the word ' 都 ' is sometimes used for laypersons .
aside from this , depending on regions , the one word is more prevalent than the other , and there are no unified rules .
** it is said that the word ' 奥 ( oku ) ' means ' deep ' ' 奥 ( oku ) ' or ' to put ' ' 置く ( oku ) ' .
the connotations of the word ' 奥都城 ( okutsuki ) ' as a whole is ' an inner space that is shielded from the outer world ' and also ' a place where a coffin is put . '
** shinto-style grave
the basic structure ( of shinto-style graves ) is the same as buddhist-style graves except that shinto-style graves have no incense burners because " shoko " ( incense offering ) is not practiced in shinto .
also , in shinto graves , hassoku-dai ( a platform supported by eight legs ) is used for the display of " tamagushi " ( branch of a sacred tree ) .
** headstones have a thin and narrow cubic shape with a square pyramid head
it is said that this shape represents ama no murakumo no tsurugi sword , one of the three sacred treasures of the imperial family .
** the phrase " xxx-ke no okutsuki " ( okutsuki for the xxxs ) is inscribed on headstones .
for graves that have no headstones , the phrase " xxx ushi ( toji ) no mikoto no okutsuki " ( okutsuki for the soul of mr . ( s ) . xxx " ) is inscribed on graveposts .
because shinto does not use kaimyo ( posthumous buddhist names ) , the honorific titles such as ' 之霊 , ' ' 命 , ' ' 命霊 , ' and ' 霊位 ' are added to the end of surnames .
** in general , shinto shrines do not own a graveyard .
when planning to set up a shinto-style grave , you are required to buy a space in public or private cemeteries .
** the graves of japanese imperial soldiers were often set up as shinto graves .
** shinshoku ( shinto priest )
** summary
** the term " shinshoku " refers to a person who serves god and performs a religious ceremony and clerical work at a shrine of shinto .
** the term " kannushi " originally referred to the head of shinshoku in a shrine , but now it is used in the same sense of shinshoku .
the term " shinkan " refers to a government official ( civil servant ) who performs religious ceremonies ; until world war ii , only the shrine workers at the " jingu shicho " ( the government agency that oversaw shrines ) were so described .
after the constitution of japan went into effect , the separation of religion from politics was stipulated and there is no shinkan at present .
** although shinshoku was limited to men before world war ii , qualified women became able to assume shinshoku after the war .
** the way to become shinshoku
there are many ways to become shinshoku , but the most straightforward is to graduate from a shinto-affiliated university .
** yet in order to be allowed to enter some such training schools one must obtain a recommendation from a shrine agency , meaning that the first step for a prospective student is to meet and discuss the matter with an acquaintance who is also a shinshoku .
it is also possible to take the certification exam solely through correspondence courses , but this option is available only to those who must obtain qualification very quickly ( for example , those who are slated to succeed to headship of the family ' s shrine ) .
** the five ranks of shinto priests
the " regulations on the certification and conferment of rank " issued by the jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) list the following five ranks :
the ranks under meikai can be achieved after finishing the predetermined training course .
the names for all the ranks were taken from some part of the term " jomyoseichoku " ( pure , clear , correct , honest ) , which epitomizes the four virtues of shinto .
** jokai
the highest rank of shinshoku , jokai is granted to those who have made longstanding contributions to research on shinto .
** meikai
possessors of this rank can also become the guji ( high priest ) of any shrine , with the single exception of ise jingu shrine , which requires an imperial decision in order to become daiguji ( great high priest ) .
** seikai ( the fourth rank of shinto priest )
this is the level of qualification required to become the guji of a regular shrine or a negi ( assistant to guji ) at a beppyo-jinja shrine .
** gonseikai ( the fourth rank of shinto priest )
the qualification necessary to become a negi .
in some cases it is also possible for priests of this rank to become guji of regular shrines .
** chokkai ( the fifth rank of shinto priest )
the basic rank necessary to become a negi of a common shrine .
** social status levels of shinto priests
** the selection of the status levels is made based on one ' s career and achievement to the shrine society .
** choro ( patriarch )
** the system of dress
the jinja-honcho has determined the system of dress that governs formal , ceremonial , and everyday attire ; regulations differ according to the aforementioned status levels .
** formal attire ( equivalent to ikan , or formal court attire )
formal attire is worn for grand festivals ( including rei-taisai festivals , the niinamesai festival , and special festivals related with the construction of shrines . )
** tokkyu
examples of tokkyu attire include kuroho ( black vests , adorned with wanashikarakusa-mon crests ) , shironubakama ( white hakama , adorned with shiroyatsufuji-mon crests ) , and court caps ( adorned with shige-mon crests ) .
ikkyu
ikkyu attire includes kuroho ( black vests , with wanashikarakusa-mon crests ) , murasakinubakama ( purple hakama , with shiroyatsufuji-mon crests ) , and court caps ( with shige-mon crests ) .
nikyu-jo
nikyu-jo attire includes akaho ( red vests , with wanashikarakusa-mon crests ) , murasakinubakama ( purple hakama , with usumurasakiyatsufuji-mon crests ) , and court caps ( with shige-mon crests ) .
nikyu
nikyu attire includes akaho ( red vests , with wanashikarakusa-mon crests ) , murasakinubakama ( purple hakama , without crests ) , and court caps ( with shige-mon crests ) .
sankyu
sankyu attire includes konho ( deep blue vests , without crests ) , , asaginubakama ( light blue hakama , without crests ) , and court caps ( with to-mon crests ) .
yonkyu
yonkyu attire includes konho ( deep blue vests , without crests ) , asaginubakama ( light blue hakama , without crests ) , and court caps ( with to-mon crests ) .
** ceremonial dress ( white informal court dress with no crest )
saifuku are worn during mid-level festivals like saitansai ( a shinto ritual that marks the new year ) , kigensai ( a ceremony commemorating the founding of japan ) , and tenchosai ( a festival in honor of the emperor ) .
** everyday attire ( meaning kariginu , or informal attire worn by court nobles )
examples include kariginu , sashiko ( a type of hakama , with the same colors as in formal attire ) , and eboshi ( a type of headwear for court nobles ) .
** except for a handful of prohibited colors , any color or crest can be used on kariginu .
prohibited colors are those reserved for the nobility ; the jinja-honcho forbids use of two colors , stipulating that korosen ( yellow-brown ) be reserved only for the emperor and oni ( reddish yellow ) only for the crown prince .
** kariginu are worn for small-scale festivals ( monthly kanreisai ) , for kanreishiki ( annual ceremonies like oharae , the " great purification " ) , as well as for ground-breaking ceremonies , festivals of supplicatory prayer and other shinto rituals .
for festivals that require purification , in particular , the " jo-e " ( a special outfit worn for religious ceremonies ) , which consists of a white kariginu , shirosashiko and eboshi ( all without crests ) are worn , regardless of status levels .
** the various roles played by shinshoku during shinto rituals are classified into two categories : saishu , who preside over rituals , and saiin , who assist the saishu by carrying ceremonial objects or passing tamagushi ( branches from sacred trees ) to the saishu by hand .
for such rituals , in principle all participants wear the same attire .
** this is because , in order to show shinshoku in a dignified manner , formal attire was made bulky and restrictive of movement .
as a result , in many ordinary shrines , only saishu observe the official rules of dress , while everyone from saiin on down garb themselves in the attire appropriate for small-scale festivals ( i . e . , everyday attire ) .
and at some ordinary shrines rituals must be conducted entirely by a single guji , who has to carry the ceremonial objects himself and pass himself the tamagushi .
therefore , in some cases even grand or mid-level festivals are conducted in everyday attire at some ordinary shrines .
** in addition , the costumes for funeral and wedding ceremonies are as follows :
** funeral attire
in the shinto funeral , the ikan or kariginu of nibiiro ( dark gray ) with no crest is used without regard to status levels .
in this case , saishu often wears ikan and saiin often wears kariginu .
the nibiiro ( dark gray color ) of the funeral attire is regarded as an inauspicious color and as such its use is prohibited in everyday clothing , just as are the other prohibited colors .
but in fact , at shrines that do not hold many funerals or at ordinary shrines in rural areas , not all shinshoku own funeral attire , so some wear saifuku or a white jo-e during funerals instead .
** wedding attire
there is no set attire for conducting wedding ceremonies , but typically the same attire as that for the category of " other shinto rituals " , or in other words the same as that for small-scale festivals ( so kariginu or jo-e ) , is worn .
in cases where ceremonies are conducted by more than one shinshoku , most often both wear white , with the saishu in saifuku and the saiin in jo-e .
** shokkai ( the ranking of positions )
the ranking of positions within shrines is called " shokkai . "
there are some difference between shrines depending on their size and history , but in general three different ranks are used : guji , negi , and gonnegi .
in principle , a guji and a negi are assigned to each shrine .
some beppyo-jinja shrines are also assigned a gonguji under the guji .
on the most basic level , guji are shrines ' main representatives , gonguji are deputy representatives , negi are assistants to the guji , and gonnegi are general clerical workers .
ise-jingu shrine is different , however ; a saishu and a daiguji as well as shoguji , negi , gonnegi and kujo ( one rank below gonnegi ) are all assigned to work there .
** moreover , maihime ( female religious dancers ) and miko ( shrine maidens ) are not classified as shinshoku .
** a guji of a given shrine is considered equal in rank to all other guji regardless of the sizes of their respective shrines , provided only that the said shrines are recognized by the jinja-honcho .
for example , while they might differ in actual influence , the guji of a beppyo-jinja shrine is of the same de jure rank as the guji of a tiny rural shrine .
in addition , the shokkai is different from the ranks , and the status of upper shokkai is regarded higher as shinshoku .
in other words , the rank of guji of seikai is higher than that of negi of meikei .
** nomi no sukune
** personal profile
** nomi no sukune is a person who appears in " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
he is a god of sumo ( 相撲 : japanese style of wrestling ) .
** it is said that he was a brave warrior of izumo province ( present eastern tottori prefecture ) and was a 00th generation descendant of amenohohi , one of the sons of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) .
for that he was awarded an area called taima in yamato province , which was possessed by taima no kehaya , and served the court .
** the haji clan took charge of emperors ' funeral for generations , and later changed its title to the oe clan and the sugawara clan .
** the biography of katano-jinja shrine ( hirakata city , osaka prefecture ) says that nomi no sukune was awarded kawachi province ( present eastern osaka prefecture ) from the emperor suinin for winning in the fight against taima no kehaya .
according to harima no kuni fudoki ( the topography of harima province , present south-eastern hyogo prefecture ) , he died from an illness in tatsuno of harima province ( present tatsuno city , hyogo prefecture ) and was buried there .
a story handed down in kamosu-jinja shrine ( matsue city , tottori prefecture ) tells that he trained himself using the ' rock ' situated in the hill at the back of the shrine .
** shrines which are sacred to nomi no sukune include sumo-jinja shrine which is an auxiliary shrine of anashinimasuhyozu-jinja shrine ( sakurai city , nara prefecture ) and nomi no sukune-jinja shrine ( tatsuno city , hyogo prefecture , and sumida ward , tokyo ) .
** as stated earlier , he is an ancestor of sugawara no michizane who is known as the god of learning , and from the sugawara clan derived the gojo family , a court noble .
the gojo family became sumai no tsukasa ( in charge of sumo matches held in the presence of the emperor ) since they were a descendant of nomi no sukune .
it is considered that the mori clan and the sakai clan were descended from oe no hiromoto of the oe clan which was also offspring of nomi no sukune .
** takamimusubi
** takamimusubi is one of the gods who appear in japanese mythology .
it is written as 高御産巣日神 in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , and as 高皇産霊神 in " nihonshoki " ( the chronicles of japan ) .
the name can also be written as 高皇産霊尊 ( takamimusubi no mikoto ) as an enshrined deity .
** as tenson ninigi no mikoto , the grandson of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) was born by the marriage of amenooshihomimi ( son of amaterasu ) and a daughter of takamimusubi no kami , takamimusubi is equivalent to tenson ninigi ' s maternal grandfather .
** according to kojiki , ame no minakanushi no kami first came into being in takamagahara ( the plain of high heaven ) at the time of the creation of heaven and earth ( japanese mythology ) , and then appeared takamimusubi no kami together with another kami called kamimusubi .
** but there is also a view that takamimusubi is the primary god from whom the imperial family is believed to be descended based on a legend existing in the tensonkorin related mythology that he was in full control of tensonkorin , gaining ascendancy over amaterasu omikami
** it is said that kamimusubi no kami is active in the izumo mythology and takamimusubi no kami in the takamagahara mythology .
** it gave such offence to takamimusubi no kami who then shot back the same arrow and killed ame no wakahiko .
** omoikane and takuhatachijihime no mikoto are the children of takamimusubi no kami .
** ame no minakanushi no kami
** ame no minakanushi no kami is one of the gods ( shinto ) who appear in japanese mythology .
** he is one of the five pillars of kotoamatsukami ( literally , separate heavenly gods ) who were involved in the creation .
** ame no minakanushi no kami as described in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters )
in kojiki , ame no minakanushi no kami is described as the first god who made an appearance in " takamagahara " ( the plain of high heaven or the japanese olympus ) at the time of the creation of heaven and earth ( japanese mythology ) .
kojiki further describes that a couple of kami appeared later and soon disappeared , namely takamimusubi and kamimusubi .
these three pillars of gods are called " zoka-sanshin " ( three kami of creation ) , who are said to be genderless ' hitorigami ' ( god without gender ) .
** ame no minakanushi no kami as described in " nihonshoki " ( the chronicles of japan )
there is no description of this kami in the main version of nihonshoki , and one is found only in the fourth of the six " alternate writings " quoted in its section 0 .
from these descriptions it is not clear which god came into being first .
** various theories
the name of this kami implies that it is the presiding god sitting in the middle of heaven ( takamagahara ) .
he is regarded as the origin of the cosmos or as the cosmos itself .
** no mention whatsoever is made either in kojiki or nihonshoki of this kami ' s subsequent deeds , and this kami is said to be ' chukushin ' ( literally , a god without form ) .
it is considered that this kami is a conceptual god created in the course of the formation of the kojiki and nihonshoki mythology under the influence of the chinese thought of the lord of heaven .
** taneatsu hirata ( a scholar of japanese classical literature in the late edo period ) read a number of proscribed books concerning christianity and was strongly influenced by its idea of god as the creator of all nature .
these three kami are regarded as the ultimate gods in " fukko shinto " ( revived shinto ) , and in particular ame no minakanushi no kami is ranked first .
** shrines
this kami had not been the object of worship for long since the japanese mythology hardly contains any description of it and as this kami is not directly related to people ' s daily lives .
only after the medieval period did it begin to be worshipped in temples and onmyodo ( way of yin and yang ; occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements ) .
** myoken-sha shrine group has its origin in the belief in taoism ' s supreme god residing in the heaven ' s center ( tien-huang-ta-ti ) .
furthermore , ame no minakanushi no kami was worshipped in daikyoin ( great teaching institute ) early in the meiji period , and several shrines altered their enshrined deity to this kami .
such shrines as chiba-jinja shrine which has strong connection with chiba clan , kunohe-jinja shrine with kunohe clan and chichibu-jinja shrine in saitama prefecture all enshrine ame no minakanushi no kami through the myoken worship link .
there are over 00 myoken-sha shrines in chiba prefecture , counting only those which have registered as a religious corporation .
an innumerable number of small myoken-sha shrines are located all over japan .
** kamimusubi
** kamimusubi ( or kamimusuhi , kamumusubi ) is a god ( shinto ) in japanese mythology .
** at the time of creation of heaven and earth ( japanese mythology ) , kamimusubi appeared at the takamanohara ( the plain of high heaven ) following ame no minakanushi no kami and takamimusubi .
kamimusubi is supposed to be one of kotoamatsukami ( literally , separate heavenly kami ) .
originally kamimusubi is a hitorigami ( god without gender ) , being neither man or woman ; however , kamimusubi is sometimes said to be the only goddess among the zoka-sanshin ( three gods of creation ) .
also in sendai kujihongi ( ancient japanese history ) , kamimusubi is said to be the child of takamimusubi no kami .
** when okuninushi ( chief god of izumo in southern honshu island , japan , and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region ) was killed by other senior kami , the mother of okuninushi pleaded kamimusubi no kami to revive okuninushi .
thanks to the treatment by kisagai-hime and umugi-hime who were sent by kamimusuhi no mikoto ( a . k . a . kamimusubi no kami ) , onamuchi no mikoto ( a . k . a . okuninushi ) was brought back to his life .
** in the " kojiki , " sukunabikona is the child of kamimusubi no kami .
** the word ' musuhi ' means production and generation .
kamimusubi is a kami of ' creation ' along with takamimusubi no kami .
also kamimusubi is thought to be a symbol of ' ties ' between men and women in pairs with takamimusubi no kami .
** imi
** what is imi ( 忌み or 斎み ) ?
** to purify ourselves , avoid impurities , and be discreet to deities .
purification .
** ( by extension ) something that is taboo .
taboo .
restraint .
** after the heian period , its examples are contained in the meaning of 0 . in most cases .
** outline
it is basically to dislike and eliminate the muck ( impurity ) that has a harmful effect on the living space .
** natural disasters such as typhoon , heavy rain , drought , or earthquake were also considered unclean impure , and were purified and cleared up through a lustral ceremony such as a ground-breaking ceremony .
** imi in shinto rituals .
fire called imibi is built inside shrines during shinto rituals .
therefore fire is called so when it is used this way .
also since fire was considered to carry the muck , measures to use separate ovens were taken .
according to kojiki ( the record of ancient matters ) , izanami was burned her private part for giving a birth to kami of fire ( honokagutsuchinokami ) .
she died from this , and went down to yominokuni ( realm of the dead ) .
** used in the words , ' close fire is also dreadful <makura no soshi ( the pillow book , extremely dreadful things ) > ' , or ' a match may cause a fire ' at the present days , fire has been recognized as a dangerous thing .
imibi is sometimes identified with the olympic torch , but there is no culture to worship flames in shinto .
originally the ' fire ' in shinto is a muck .
therefore deities preventing it such as hibuse no kami ( god of fire prevention ) and hibuse no mikoto were worshipped .
there is also an expression , chinka ( to extinguish fire ) .
** there are exceptions , but generally death in shinto is ' imi ' as an impurity ( kurofujo , or black impurity ) .
it is believed that deities hate it .
therefore people don ' t take deceased person ' s bodies and hold funerals inside shrines or on their premises .
they cover household shinto altar with hanshi ( standard-size japanese writing paper ) so it won ' t reach the deities ' eyes .
death ( kurofujo , or black impurity ) , menstrual blood ( akafujo , or red impurity ) , and childbirth ( shirofujo , or white impurity ) had been considered to be impurities hated by deities and had been avoided .
this value was widely changed by the modernization and policy of increasing wealth and military power by meiji government .
** being killed in war was shifted from a muck to an honor , and childbirth was shifted from a personal matter to a national project having the slogan of ' give birth to a lot of children and increase the population ' .
and to praise women for performing it , a new value opposite the value of impurity came into existence in shinto .
that is the ' state shinto ' .
the details of the standard of impurities before meiji period is written in ' the engishiki ' ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) .
** examples
imikirau
- expel impurities + hate .
hate as if to expel impurities .
** imina
- neat + names .
neat names : real names which became shinto and buddhist deities .
real names ( which was a taboo for the subjects or lower ranking people to call ) .
** kichu ( ki ( 忌 ) + chu ( period ) )
- the period of muck .
** during nara period , inbe clan ( 忌部氏 , later 斎部氏 ) administered shinto rituals in the imperial court .
although in ( 忌 ) also means neat , it is used in negative sense in most cases after heian period .
** sengu
** a sengu is the temporary transfer of a shintai ( an object of worship housed in a shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) .
sengu is conducted when the honden ( main building ) of a shrine is being built and repaired or when a new honden is being constructed .
it refers to the construction , repair and reconstruction of the honden as well as its rites and festivals .
shosengu is a planned sengu .
a karidono sengu is the transfer to a tentative building when a honden needs unexpected repair or reconstruction due to a natural disaster or other catastrophe .
a rinji sengu is an extraordinary transfer , in which the same rituals are conducted as in a shosengu in order to transfer shintai to a newly built honden due to unforeseen circumstances .
sometimes , the sengu is classified as described above .
the term " sengu " often refers to the jingu shikinen sengu of ise-jingu shrine ( ise city , mie prefecture ) .
at all other shrines , sengu is sometimes differentiated from the concept of senza .
** the main buildings of both the shogu ( main shrine ) and betsugu ( auxiliary associated shrines ) of ise-jingu shrine are in general subject to regular rebuilding efforts every 00 years ; such renewals are called " shikinen sengu . "
the word " shikinen , " when used in the context , means a fixed year .
sengu used to be conducted at sumiyoshi-taisha shrine ( sumiyoshi ward , osaka city ) , katori-jingu shrine , kashima-jingu shrine , usa-jingu shrine , kasuga-taisha shrine and suwa-taisha shrine ( =>onbashira-sai festival ) .
yet the main building of sumiyoshi-taisha shrine has not been rebuilt since 0000 , merely repaired on the occasion of the transfer of its shintai to a temporary structure .
however , the term shikinen sengu is still in use today .
( the main building of sumiyoshi-taisha shrine has been designated as a national treasure , so it can ' t be reconstructed . )
** shikinen sengu is considered to be part of shiki nen sai ( religious festivals held on fixed years ) .
** small shrines also conduct sengu , as exemplified by shinmei-jinja shrine in ago-cho , shima city , mie prefecture , which has conducted a sengu every 00 years since 0000 in the mid-edo period .
** myojin
** 明神 ( pronounced as ' myojin ' ) is an honorable title used in japanese shinto for gods .
( when the word ' 明神 ' is used to describe emperors , it is pronounced as ' akitsumikami . '
please consult the word ' 現人神 ' ( arahitogami ) . )
** in yoshida shinto , ' myojin ' is used as " shingo " ( a title given to a deceased person who becomes a god ) .
a famous example is ' hokoku dai-myojin ' ( great luminous deity of our bountiful country ) , which was given to ( the deceased ) hideyoshi toyotomi .
the word ' myojin ' implies that gods appear not as their tentative self but as their real self with a clear form .
** a famous example is ' tosho dai-gongen , ' which was given to ( the deceased ) ieyasu tokugawa .
** incidentally , over the shingo for ieyasu , a famous dispute took place between ( buddhist priest ) tenkai , who advanced ' dai-gongen , ' and ( buddhist priest ) suden , who suggested ' dai-myojin . '
** during the period when buddhism was disseminated among countries , some countries saw conflict between buddhism and their local gods , but japan incorporated buddhism by concluding that gods would protect buddhists ( syncretism of shinto and buddhism ) .
as a result , deities have been worshipped while being called ' -myojin ' in one time and ' -gongen ' in another time .
** upon the enactment of the ordinance distinguishing shinto and buddhism in the early meiji period , people were prohibited from officially use the word ' myojin ' together with other words such as ' gongen ' and " hachiman daibosatsu " ( great bodhisattava hachiman ) .
** incidentally , the origin of the word ' myojin ' is a buddhist word .
** kojikiden
** its history
** its content
** " kojikiden " or " furukotofumi no tsutae " is forty-four volumes of commentaries on " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) by norinaga motoori , a scholar of japanese classical literature in the edo period .
this book is casually referred to as " kiden . "
** norinaga started writing the book in 0000 and finished it in 0000 , spending as many as thirty-five years completing it .
this book was published in print from 0000 to 0000 , during which norinaga died .
** in 0000 , norinaga , aged 00 , who had studied medicine in kyoto , bought " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " sendai kujihongi ( ancient japanese history ) : lineage of the mononobe and soga clans " at a book store .
in 0000 , the following year , norinaga set out to work on " kojikiden . "
however , it took him as many as thirty-five years before it was completed in 0000 , during which he wrote other books , including " tamakatsuma " ( a collection of essays ) and " uiyamabumi " ( first steps into the mountain ) .
** before giving commentaries on kojiki , norinaga had to determine its body of text by collating a large number of copies and carefully comparing , examining , and revising differences among them .
then , he provided ancient words with japanese reading and detailed commentaries . ( this style was taken over by kenji kurano , who later wrote " kojiki zenchushaku " ( a comprehensive commentary on the kojiki ) .
** norinaga ' s " kojikiden " is regarded as a top-level study of kojiki in the pre-modern period and appreciated as the first positivist , philological work .
the ancient special kana usage , which is now widely accepted by japanese language scholars , was also discovered by norinaga .
in providing commentaries on kojiki in " kojikiden , " he established kokugaku ( the study of japanese classical literature ) , which worships the age of japanese deities .
** its influence on studies of literature and history
" kojikiden " is not only comprehensive commentaries on " kojiki , " but also had an immense impact on research into ancient literature and history .
even in the twenty-first century , his book continues to be referred to by the scholars of " kojiki " and ancient culture as the authoritative book .
it is fair to say that today ' s commentaries on " kojiki " have mostly adopted the reading and interpretation by norinaga although some corrections have been made to them by later researchers .
on the other hand , there are various criticisms from people who oppose his commentaries and interpretations .
** his theory and that of hakuseki arai , who insisted that the kingdom was in yamato ( the kinki region ) , have become the source of controversy called controversy over yamataikoku .
** other
the cover title of " kojikiden " ( " 古事記伝 " ) was written by harutomi tokunaga , the tenth lord of the kishu domain , who employed norinaga , as a token of his appreciation .
** amenohohi
** amenohohi is a god ( shinto ) who appears in the japanese mythology .
the kanji used for amenohohi are 天之菩卑能命 , 天穂日命 , or 天菩比神 .
** amenohohi was born from the magadama ( a comma-shaped bead ) amaterasu was wearing around her right mizura hair when amaterasu and susanoo made the oath of amaterasu and susanoo .
amenohohi is regarded as the second child of amaterasu , who was the owner of the monozane ( medium to produce something ) , and as the younger brother of amenooshihomimi .
as amenohohi was trying to convince okuninushi to give up his power over ashinohara no nakatsukuni , amenohohi came to have a high regard for okuninushi , and became his retainer .
amenohohi came to live on the ground and did not come back to takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) for three years .
afterward , amenohohi built the kamosu-jinja shrine ( matsue city , shimane prefecture ) to enshrine izanami in izumo province .
amenohohi ' s child , takehiratori no mikoto is said to have become the soshin ( ancestor honored as god ) of izumo no kuninomiyatsuko and others .
** in other words , izumo kokuso kanyogoto describes amenohohi as a great god who settled the ground .
however , it should be noted that izumo kokuso kanyogoto was written by izumo no kuninomiyatsuko , who were the descendents of amenohohi ; this fact may need to be taken into consideration .
** amenohohi is professed as a god of agriculture , rice ear , sericulture , cotton , industry and others .
** sarutahiko
** description by myths
** sarutahiko is a deity who appears in japanese mythology ( shinto ) .
** the god , whose nose is about 00 cm in length , stands about 000 centimeters tall and has eyes that shine like " yata no kagami " ( the eight-span mirror ; one of the sacred treasures of the imperial family ) or bladder cherries .
observing the scene , amaterasu-omikami and takamimusubi order " amenouzume " ( a goddess of entertainment ) to go and ask who the god is .
it is revealed that the god is sarutahiko who comes from " kunitsukami " ( gods of the land ) to guide ninigi-no-mikoto and others .
** amenouzume comes to be called ' sarume no kimi ' afterwards .
sarutahiko goes back to his homeland , in the upper reaches of the isuzu-gawa river in ise province .
** descendants of ota-no-mikoto called themselves ' ujinotsuchigimi ' and had been appointed as " tamakushi ouchindo " ( an officer in charge of presenting a sacred tree ) of ise-jingu shrine for generations .
** comment
** according to nihonshoki , amenouzume reveals her breasts and has her " mohimo " ( kind of a skirt ) dangle under her belly ( when she serves sarutahiko ) , and this is seen as an allusion to amenouzume ' s sexual relations with sarutahiko .
this description is considered to be the origin of the folklore that sarutahiko and amenouzume were married , although myths say nothing about their marriage .
** based on the sentences ' his nose is about 00 cm in length , and he stands about 000 centimeters tall , ' sarutahiko is considered to be the original model of tengu ( a long-nosed supernatural creature ) .
because ' he is the god who sheds light on heaven and earth , ' some experts theorize that sarutahiko was a sun god worshiped in ise region prior to the popularization of amaterasu-omikami .
** tsubaki-okamiyashiro grand shrine in suzuka city , mie prefecture and sarutahiko-jinja shrine located at ujiurata , ise city , mie prefecture are famous for the enshrinement of sarutahiko .
** because sarutahiko guided the grandson of the sun goddess during tensonkorin , he came to be regarded as a god of roads and travelers and designated the same position as that of doso-shin , doso-jin , ( traveler ' s guardian deity ) .
as a result , in many places across japan , ' sarutahiko-no-kami ' is worshipped as " sai-no-kami " ( a god who prevents evil spirits from entering areas ) and doso-shin .
in this case , sarutahiko is usually enshrined together with amenouzume , his alleged wife .
** in addition , sarutahiko is enshrined under the name of ' shirahige-myogin ' in many places across japan because he was appointed as the enshrined deity of shirahige-jinja shrine in takashima city , shiga prefecture .
sarutahiko and ota-no-mikoto , his descent , and sometimes sarutahiko and okitama no kami of ise-jingu shrine are considered to have the same identity .
** as can be seen above , sarutahiko has a complicated divinity .
recently , because of his complexity sarutahiko has been researched intensively as ' a mysterious deity ' by scholars such as toji kamata .
a family named ' saruta ' settled in hitachi province , and it is alleged that they were descendants of sarutahiko .
the " guji " ( chief of those who serves shrine , controls festivals and general affairs ) of the previously cited tsubaki-okamiyashiro grand shrine and sarutahiko-jinja shrine have been famously regarded as the divine descendants of sarutahiko through the ages .
in the " hinotori ( phoenix ) " ( manga ) series made by osamu tezuka , characters named ' saruta , ' of ' sarutahiko ' often appear .
a large portion of them are physically characterized by their large noses .
** amenooshihi-no-mikoto
** amenooshihi no mikoto is a god ( shinto ) which appears in japanese mythology .
amenooshihi no mikoto is said to be the soshin ( ancestor honored as god ) of the otomo clan .

it does not appear in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
amenooshihi no mikoto armed along with amatsukume no mikoto , who is said to be the soshin of the kume clan , and led ninigi no mikoto .
** although the " kojiki " does not describe the origin of amenooshihi no mikoto , according to the family trees of the otomo clan and other materials , amenooshihi no mikoto is said to be the child of takamimusubi no mikoto .
michinoomi no mikoto , who accompanied jinmu tosei ( eastern expedition of the emperor jinmu ) and later became the founder of the otomo clan , is said to be the great-grand child of amenooshihi no mikoto .
** there are not many shrines that have amenooshihi no mikoto as its enshrined deity .
furuhata-jinja shrine ( kanan-cho , minamikawachi-gun , osaka prefecture ) , aburahi-jinja shrine ( koga city , shiga prefecture ) , and yahosa-jinja shrine ( iki city , nagasaki prefecture ) enshrine amenooshihi no mikoto .

** oyamatsumi
** oyamatsumi is the god described in japanese mythology .
another name is watashi no okami or sakatoke no kami .
there are not many descriptions about oyamatsumi himself , but the god called the son of oyamatsumi sometimes appears in the myth .
** descriptions in japanese mythology
in kamiumi ( giving birth to gods ) , oyamatsumi was born between izanagi and izanami .
later , he and kayano-hime , the god of the field , bore eight gods forming four pairs as follows .
** amenosazuchi no kami , kuninosazuchi no kami
amenosagiri no kami , kuninosagiri no kami
amenokurado no kami , kuninokurado no kami
otomadoiko no kami , otomadoime no kami
** then , when izanagi killed kagutsuchi with a sword , the following eight yamatsumi gods were born from the body of kagutsuchi .
** masakayamatsumi no kami
odoyamatsumi no kami
okuyamatsumi no kami
kurayamatsumi no kami
shigiyamatsumi no kami
hayamatsumi no kami
harayamatsumi no kami
toyamatsumi no kami
** in the fighting with yamata no orochi , ashinazuchi and tenazuchi , whose daughter kushinada-hime later became the wife of susanoo , said that they were children of oyamatsumi .
then , susanoo and kamuohoichi-hime , who was a daughter of ohoyamatsumi , had sons , otoshi no kami and ukanomitama , as described in susanoo ' s genealogical table .
on the other hand , yashimajinumi , who was a son of susanoo and kushinada-hime , married konohanachiru-hime and fuhanomojikunusunu was born .
okuninushi is the descendant of fuhanomojikunusunu .
** after tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) , ninigi met the daughter of oyamatsumi , konohana no sakuya-bime , and then oyamatsumi gave konohana no sakuya-bime and her older sister iwanaga-hime to ninigi .
** explanation
in the names of gods , ' tsu ' means ' no ' ( of ) and ' mi ' means god , so ' oyamatsumi ' means ' the god of oyama ( big mountain ) . '
in another name watashi no okami , ' wata ' is an archaic word meaning sea , and this name represents the god of the sea .
therefore , he is the god of both the mountain and the sea as represented by his names .
additionally , it is described that oyamatsumi was pleased when konohana no sakuya-bime bore hohodemi , and he made amenotamu-zake for offering to the gods , and this also made him sakatoke no kami , the god of sake .
further , he is believed to be gunshin or bushin ( the god of war ) .
** oyama afuri-jinja shrine ( isehara city , kanagawa prefecture ) , umenomiya-taisha shrine ( ukyo word , kyoto city ) , and all mishima-jinja shrines and ozumi-jinja shrines ( 大祇神社 ) throughout japan are dedicated to oyamatsumi .
the head shrines of mishima-jinja shrines and ozumi-jinja shrines ( 大祇神社 ) for all parts of japan are oyamazumi-jinja shrine ( omishima-cho , imabari city , ehime prefecture ) and mishima-jinja shrine ( mishima city , shizuoka prefecture ) , respectively .
** ogetsuhime
** anecdotes
** explanation
** origins
** ogetsuhime ( ohogetsuhime ) is a deity who appears in the japanese mythology .
** the ' o ' and ' ge ' in her name mean ' a lot of ' and ' food ' respectively , and she is a deity of grain and food .
** her name first appears in kojiki ( the record of ancient matters ) as the name of awa province in iyononinashima ( shikoku ) in connection with the story of kuniumi ( the birth of japan ) .
according to the description in kojiki concerning kamiumi ( the birth of deities ) , she was born between izanagi and izanami .
regarding the reason why the original name of awa province was ogetsuhime , it is generally explained that it was merely a pun using awa and the name of a grain ' awa ( millet ) . '
on the other hand , some assert that this province was named awa province because ogetsuhime , a deity of grain , was enshrined in this province .
** after being exiled from takamanohara , susano felt hungry and asked ogetsuhime for food , and ogetsuhime slowly gave susano various kinds of food .
susano , who was suspicious of her behavior , watched how ogetsuhime was preparing food and found that ogetsuhime was pulling food out of her nose , mouth , and anus , and cooking it .
susano became angry for being fed such dirty food and killed ogetsuhime with a sword .
then , silkworms were born from ogetsuhime ' s head , rice plants were born from her eyes , millet from her ears , azuki beans from her nose , barley from her nether regions and beans from her rear end .
** while the goddess ogetsuhime was described in kojiki ( record of ancient matters ) as the origin of grain or silkworm breeding , a similar anecdote in which tsukuyomi killed ukemochi with a sword appears in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** furthermore , although ogetsuhime must have been killed by susano in this incident , the lineage of otoshi no kami ( the guardian deity of grain ) , which was compiled later , describes that she gave birth to eight deities as a wife of hayamato .
** while she has been worshipped as a deity of grain and silkworm breeding , she is also enshrined at inari-sha shrines in place of ukanomitama since she was confused in later years with inari-shin ( a deity of harvest ) , who is also a deity of grain .
** myths that domesticated plants , especially root vegetables , were born from the body of a murdered person are found in south-east asia , oceania , middle and south america , and africa .
the background of these myths may be the fact that potatoes revive after being cut and buried in the ground .
it is contemplated that the reason why grain was derived from ogetsuhime was because grains were the principal cultivated plant in japan .
** ame no hoakari ( one of the gods in japanese mythology )
** ame no hoakari is a shinto god that appears in japanese mythologies .
it was also called ikishinikiho no mikoto , and amaterasu mitama no kami in " jinja shiryo " ( an history of shrines ) .
the god is usually called hoakari no mikoto .
hoakari no mikoto is an ancestor honored as a god for many clans such as the owari clan ( owari muraji group ) and the kaifu clan .
** ame no hoakari was born to the deities amenooshihomimi and takuhatachijihime no mikoto , a daughter of takamimusubi .
ninigi was ame no hoakari ' s younger brother , but was described as a son of ame no hoakari in one of the editions of " nihonshoki . "
in " sendai kujihongi , " ame no hoakari was identified as nigihayahi no mikoto , who was the ancestor of the mononobe clan .
in " harimanokuni-fudoki " ( topography of harima province ) , ameno hoakari was described as a child of okuninushi ( chief god of izumo of the southern honshu island , japan , and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region ) .
** as the names amateru kuniteruhiko and hoakari suggest , ame no hoakari is deification of sunlight or heat .
ame no hoakari is worshipped as a god of the sun as well as agriculture .
for this reason , the roots of ame no hoakari is believed to be in the lineage of ameno hohino mikoto , which is an izumogami of the amatsu kami ( god of heaven ) group .
** in " shinsen shojiroku " ( newly compiled register of clan names and titles of nobility ) , descendents of ame no hoakari are called the ' tenson ' ( grandsons of the sun goddess ( clan ) .
also , sukune tamino who enshrined sumiyoshi sanjin and built the sumiyoshi-taisha shrine ( sumiyoshi ward , osaka city ) was one of the owari clan , and his descendents are the tsumori clan that has held the position of chief priest of the sumiyoshi-taisha shrine for generations .
** note also that ame no hoakari has been enshrined at many of the amaterumitama-jinja shrines nationwide .
** takeminakata no kami
** takeminakata no kami is a god who appeared in the japanese mythology ( shinto religion ) .
he is counted among three major japanese gods of war , together with takemikazuchi and futsunushi no kami .
his name is also expressed as minakatatomi no kami in " engishiki jinmyocho " ( the list of shrines , or " engishiki " ) .
** when the deity takemikazuchi no kami pressed okuninushi to hand over the land of japan , okuninushi said that his son , kotoshiro nushi ( a japanese ancient god ) , would reply .
when kotoshiro nushi accepted it , okuninushi said that takeminakata no kami would reply next .
takeminakata no kami offered a contest of strength to takemikazuchi no kami , whereupon he grabbed the hand of takemikazuchi no kami .
then , the hands of takemikazuchi no kami turned into ice and a sword .
takeminakata no kami was scared by that ; he ran away but was finally cornered at lake suwa , in shinano province .
when takemikazuchi no kami tried to kill takeminakata no kami , takeminakata no kami begged ' please don ' t kill me , as i will never leave this place , ' and then surrendered to takemikazuchi no kami .
it is said in tradition that the contest of strength between takemikazuchi no kami and takeminakata no kami became the origin of sumo wrestling .
this myth is only found in the kojiki ( record of ancient matters ) and his name isn ' t found in the part corresponding to the ashihara no nakatsukuniheitei in " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
** it is said that at the time of the battle , moriya-shin fought with an iron ring in his hand while takeminakata no kami held a wisteria ( a plant ) vine ; thus there is an opinion that this fight implied the match of iron-casting technologies .
** takeminakata no kami is enshrined at suwa-jinja shrines throughout japan , including suwa-taisha shrine ( suwa city , nagano prefecture ) .
he is also said to be a god of wind , and there is a tradition that it was the god of suwa who caused kamikaze ( wind of god ) at the time of the mongolian invasion .
part of his name " minakata " means " lagoon , " and it is thought that he was originally the god of water and rain .
however , there are opinions that " minakata " has a relationship to " munakata " ( the geographical name of northern kyushu ) or that he is the god of metallurgy .
** like the above , he is described in many ways despite the traditional story of disgrace .
** japanese mythological history has no record regarding his origin , but theories that he was a child of okuninushi and nunakawa-hime remain in many parts of japan .
his wife was said to be yasakatome no kami .
** takeminakata no kami was said to be the ancestor of the miwa clan ; thus he is the ujigami of suwashinto ( suwa shintoist group ) , such as the suwa and hoshina clans , who are descendants of the miwa clan .
** aratama and nikitama
** aratama refers to the vicious aspect of gods , namely savage souls .
it represents the intention by gods to cause catastrophic natural disasters , invite outbreaks of plague , and drive humans to conflicts and wars by wrecking havoc on their minds .
the curses of gods are indications of aratama .
on the contrary , nikitama refers to the gentle and tranquil aspect of gods , represented by blessings of nature such as rains and sunlight .
god ' s blessing is an indication of nikitama .
** people have presented gifts to gods as tributes and performed ceremonies and festivals to mollify gods and transform them from aratama to nikitama .
this extreme duality of gods ' souls serves as a source of the shinto faith .
also , thanks to its vigorous quality , aratama is said to contain energy that can create new phenomena and objects that can be linked with its homonym ' aratama ' ( also referred to as ' aramitama ' ) meaning ' new spirits . '
** nikitama is subdivided into ' sakitama , ' ( also referred to as ' saki ( chi ) mitama ' ) and ' kushitama ' ( also referred to as ' kushimitama ' ) .
it is said that the four ( aratama , nikitama , sakitama , and kushitama ) are parallel concepts .
sakitama presents bliss to people through luck , namely a good harvest .
kushitama present bliss directly to people through miracles .
sakitama and kushitama are represented by the word ' 豊 ' ( rich ) and ' 櫛 ' ( comb ) , respectively , and these words are used for the names of gods or shrines
** if we take a modern view , sakitama and kushitama can be interpreted as a private soul and a public soul , respectively .
it is possible to understand that sakitama and kushitama equate to ' betsutama and kamitama ' ( a branch shrine for a deity and a memento ) .
** incidentally , the word " 殯宮 " ( funeral parlor ) is pronounced ' arakinomiya ' in japanese , and the first part of this word ( i . e . " ara " ) is believed to have been derived from the word aratama .
** ashinazuchi and tenazuchi
** ashinazuchi and tenazuchi are a couple of deities ( shinto deities ) that appear in a japanese mythology about the yamatanoorochi snake .
** the mythology
ashinazuchi and tenazuchi were children of oyamatsumi who lived in the upper reaches of the hii-kawa river in izumo province .
promising to give kushinadahime to susano as his wife if he could get rid of the orochi snake , the two deities made preparations to exterminate the snake .
** explanation
many theories have been proposed about the names of these gods .
** others argue that the word ' ashina ' means ' asaine , ' or late ripening varieties of rice , and ' tena ' ' toina , ' early ripening varieties of rice .
there is also a theory according to which these names represent , respectively , ' ridge acorns ' and ' field acorns . '
** susa-jinja shrine ( izumo city , shimane prefecture ) is located on the supposed site of susano ' s palace .
the inada clan ( later susa clan ) , whose members have been hereditary priests of susa-jinja shrine , claim to be the descendents of okuninushi no mikoto and the current priest ( as of 0000 ) is the 00th generation counting from ashinazuchi and tenazuchi .
** worship
apart from susa-jinja shrine , these gods are enshrined in shrines such as hiromine-jinja shrine ( himeji city , hyogo prefecture ) and hikawa-jinja shrine ( kawagoe city , saitama prefecture ) .
** relationship with arahabaki beliefs
monkyakujin-jinja shrine ( guest god shrine ) in hikawa-jinja shrine in saitama prefecture , whose worshippers are alleged to be descendents of the mononobe clan , used to be called arahabaki-jinja shrine and is dedicated to a mysterious god called arahabaki .
** for some unknown reason , the ashinazuchi and tenazuchi gods are enshrined in this shrine along with arahabaki .
** the omononushi god of mt . miwa ( nara ) , which allegedly was originally worshipped by the mononobe clan and appears in mythology as an evil god , is believed to have been a serpent god .
there is also evidence to suggest that the arahabaki god may have been worshipped in shitennoji in osaka , which was the mononobe clan ' s sacred land .
from these facts , some people argue that omononushi is the same as arahabaki .
** the mystery about hikawa-jinja shrine has also led some people to discuss possible relationships between yamatanoorochi , arahabaki and the mononobe clan .
** ajisukitakahikone
** ajisukitakahikone or ajishikitakahikone is a shinto deity who appears in japanese mythology .
** in the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , it is written in japanese kanji as " 阿遅鉏高日子根神 , " " 阿遅志貴高日子根神 , " or " 阿治志貴高日子根神 . "
in the izumo fudoki ( topography of izumo province ) , it is written as " 阿遅須枳高日子 . "
it is also written as " 阿遅鋤高日子根神 , " or " 味耜高彦根命 . "
his other name is " kamono omikami . "
** descriptions in japanese mythology
he was born between okuninushi ( chief god of izumo in southern honshu island , japan , and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region ) and takiri-bime , one of the munakata sanjojin ( three goddesses enshrined in the munakata-taisha shirine ) .
taka-hime ( shitateru-hime ) is his half sister by the same mother .
** in the kojiki , he appears in ashihara no nakatsukuni heitei ( the conquest of the world between heaven and hell - the human world ) .
he attended the funeral of amenowakahiko , shitateru-hime ' s husband , who died because he did not report on his mission to takamanohara ( heaven ) .
however , ajisukitakahikone so closely resembled amenowakahiko that amatsukunitama , amenowakahiko ' s father , misunderstood that his son was still alive , and hugged him .
as ajisukitakahikone got angry for being confused with a dead person , he cut down the funeral house with a sword and destroyed it .
shitateru-hime composed a tanka ( a 00-syllable japanese poem ) to disclose the identity of ajisukitakahikone .
** he had a child named takitsuhiko with ame no mikaji-hime , the god of rain .
** commentary
suki or shiki ' used in this god ' s name means spade ; the deification of spade might lead him to become the god of agriculture .
according to " kojikiden ( commentaries on the kojiki ) , " ' aji ' used in his name is a synonym for ' umashi ( splendid ) , ' and ' shiki ' written as 磯城 means stone pavement .
there is another opinion that ' shiki ' means shiki in yamato province .
** the kojiki describes the way he comes and goes between heaven and earth , and how much he gets infuriated ; the izumo fudoki also describes how loudly he cries and screams , and the way he goes up and down the ladder ; these descriptions imply thunder .
ajisukitakahikone is the god combining miraculous power of spade and thunder .
** his other name means the god of kamo-sha shrine .
accordingly , he is the god of yamato which was worshiped by the kamo clan , a family of the kamo-sha shrine in katsuragi , yamato province .
however , there is an opinion that the kamo clan moved from izumo province to yamato province .
amaterasu omikami and kamono omikami are the only examples of deities which are called ' omikami ' ( great god ) from the beginning of the kojiki .
** religion
ajisukitakahikone is worshiped as the god of agriculture , thunder , or real estate business , and is enshrined in the takakamo-jinja shrine ( gose city , nara prefecture ) and tsutsukowake-jinja shrine ( tanagura-machi , higashishirakawa-gun , fukushima prefecture ) .
** hoori
** hoori ( hoori no mikoto ) is a god that appears in japanese mythology .
his alternate names are amatsuhikohikohohodemi no mikoto , hikohohodemi no mikoto and soratsuhiko .
he appears in the story of yamasachihiko and umisachihiko .
in general , he is known as yamasachihiko .
** he is the grandfather of emperor jinmu .
** description in kiki ( the kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) and nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) )
according to the " kojiki , " he was a child of ninigi and konohana no sakuya-bime .
ninigi suspected that he was a child of a kunitsukami ( god of the land ) .
in order to disprove his suspicion konohana no sakuya-bime gave birth to three gods in fire , and hoori was the youngest of the three .
he was named hoori because he was born when the fire went out .
hoderi and hosuseri were his older brothers .
his wife was toyotama-bime , who was a daughter of the sea god .
toyotama-bime gave birth to ugayafukiaezu ( the father of kamuyamato iwarehiko ( emperor jinmu ) ) .
he died after he spent 000 years in takachiho-gu shrine .
** the site of his burial is ' to the west of mt . takachiho ' according to the " kojiki , " and the ' takayanoyamanoe no misasagi tomb in himuka ' according to " nihonshoki . "
** explanation
according to the mythology , ' ho ' in the name implies fire , but ' ori ' means to bend something until it almost breaks .
in his alternate name , ' amatsuhiko ' means amatsu kami ( god of heaven ) , ' hiko ' means male ( hiko ) , and ' hohotemi ' can be considered to mean clusters of rice formed in the head of the rice plant .
furthermore , because he was born when the fire was going out , he is also associated with water , which is very important in agriculture .
incidentally , according to one section of nihonshoki the name ' hikohohodemi ' is considered to be emperor jinmu ' s name .
** the three generations of ninigi , hoori and ugayafukiaezu are called ' the three generations of himuka . '
** worship
he is worshipped as a god of rice plants and grains .
he is enshrined in such places as kagoshima-jingu shrine ( kirishima city , kagoshima prefecture ) and wakasahiko-jinja kamisha shrine ( obama city , fukui prefecture ) .
he is often enshrined with his father , ninigi , mother , konohana no sakuya-bime and wife , toyotama-bime .
** his burial sites are said to exist in various locations in southern kyushu .
in 0000 , the meiji government designated the foot of kirishima mountain range in kirishima city , kagoshima prefecture as takayanoyamanoe no misasagi tomb .
this designation was based on the description , ' to the west of mt . takachiho ' in the kojiki , assuming that ' mt . takachiho ' to be the crest of takachihonomine ( mt . takachiho ) .
** it has been passed down that hoori-gawa river , which is a tributary of gokase-gawa river in northern miyazaki prefecture , is the river in which hoori was bathed at birth .
it is said that sparrows are not found in the watershed of this river because hoori is a god of rice fields and harvest .
** hoderi
** hoderi is a god that appears in japanese mythology in the kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) .
he appears in the story of yamasachihiko and umisachihiko .
he is generally known as umisachihiko .
he is considered to be the ancestor , worshipped as a god , of ata no kimi of hayato .
** description found in the mythology
he was a child of ninigi and konohana no sakuya-bime .
ninigi suspected that he was a child of kunitsukami ( god of the land ) .
in order to disprove his suspicion konohana no sakuya-bime gave birth to three gods in fire , and hoderi was the oldest of the three .
he was named hoderi because he was born when the fire was burning fiercely and brightly .
hosuseri and hoori were his younger brothers .
** he made his living by fishing .
one day , he exchanged his tools with his younger brother , hoori , who made his living by hunting .
however , hoori lost hoderi ' s fishing hook and hoderi would not forgive him .
hoori returned , after receiving from the sea god magical items and a method of revenge .
hoderi was tormented by hoori , and he submitted to hoori .
** refer to yamasachihiko and umisachihiko for details .
** explanation
according to the mythology , ' ho ' in the name implies fire , but ' deri ' means to ' shine , ' and therefore it means ripening of the rice plant to a red color or burning fire that is shining brightly .
** the story of yamasachihiko and umisachihiko tells about hayato ' s submission .
therefore , it is considered that hoderi was included in the genealogy for this purpose .
in the body of the text in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , the ancestor that is worshipped as a god of hayato is said to be honosusori ( hosuseri ) no mikoto instead of hoderi .
in arufumi ( supplement volumes of explanatory notes in nihonshoki ) vol . 0 , all of hoderi ' s achievements mentioned in the kojiki are written as honosusori no mikoto ' s ( hosuseri ) accomplishments .
in addition , according to another section , it is stated that ninigi ' s eldest son was hosuseri .
therefore , the dominant theory is that hoderi is a god created by those who wrote the kojiki .
** hitokotonushi
** hitokotonushi is an ancient japanese god .
** descriptions in mythology and history books
hitokotonushi appears for the first time in the second volume of kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) ( 000 ) .
in 000 , when emperor yuryaku went deer hunting in mt . katsuragi in yamato province , he saw a group of people walking along the ridge of the mountain in front of him .
they were dressed just like his own group , wearing clothes dyed in blue with red strings attached .
when emperor yuryaku asked their names , the leader of the group answered , ' i am the great hitokotonushi god of katsuragi , who tells fortunes , both good and bad . '
struck with awe , the emperor told his men to present the god with bows and arrows along with the clothes they were wearing .
hitokotonushi received these presents and saw them off .
** this change in the status of hitokotonushi is believed to be a result of a decline in the status of the kamo clan , which worshipped hitokotonushi as its clan deity .
( some people believe , however , that the takakamonokami god in shoku nihongi is the kamonoomikami god enshrined in takakamo-jinja shrine , who is also known as ajisukitakahikone . )
** in nihon genpo zen-aku ryoiki ( buddhist stories ) , which was written in 000 , hitokotonushi appears as a god who serves en no ozuno ( a magician who was also a member of the kamo clan ) , showing an even more serious decline in his status .
it is written in ryoiki that en no gyoja ( ozuno ) was exiled to izu province as a result of an accusation submitted to the imperial court by hitokotonushi , who held grudges against him .
according to the ancient text ryoiki , en no gyoja cast a spell on hitokotonushi , which was allegedly still unbroken at the time ryoiki was written .
** in the noh play , katsuragi , hitokotonushi is depicted as a goddess .
** worship
the head office of the worship of hitokotonushi is katsuragi hitokotonushi-jinja shrine , which is located at the foot of mt . katsuragi in gose city , nara prefecture .
hitokotonushi , known as ' ichigon-san ' among the people in areas around the shrine , is worshipped as the god of the ' mugon mairi ' ( a shinto religious service ) , who grants any wish expressed in a single word .
** the tosa shrine in tosa province ( kochi prefecture ) , where hitokotonushi is reported to have been exiled in the shoku nihongi , worships hitokotonushi .
however , some people believe that the god enshrined in the tosa-jinja shrine is ajisukitakahikone , and at present , these gods are both worshipped as protective deities of the shrine .
** due to the similarity of names , hitokotonushi is sometimes mistakenly identified as kotoshironushi , okuninushi ' s son .
** kuebiko
** kuebiko is an ancient god that appears in japanese mythology ( shinto god ) .
** summary
kuebiko appears in a legend about nation building by okuninushi .
in this legend , okuninushi is visited by a small god from across the ocean , who would not reveal his name to anybody and whose name nobody knows .
okuninushi then visits kuebiko with his men to find out that kuebiko is a scarecrow standing in a rice paddy on a mountain .
in response to okuninushi ' s question , kuebiko answers that the visiting god is kamimusubi ' s son named sukunabikona .
** kuebiko is a scarecrow deified as the god of rice paddies in farming and local communities .
due to their shape , scarecrows are often regarded as symbols of gods .
in some areas of japan , scarecrows are worshipped as symbols of mountain gods in scarecrow festivals held at the time of harvest or during new year holidays .
standing in rice paddies all day long watching what goes on in the world , scarecrows came to be regarded as knowing everything .

** munakata sanjojin
** munakata sanjojin ( three goddesses of munakata ) is a collective name for mihashira no menokami ( three female gods ) enshrined at munakata-taisha shrine ( munakata city , fukuoka prefecture ) .
** they are deities who have been highly valued since the ancient times by the yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) as the goddesses of genkai-nada sea , protecting maritime traffic to korea .
munakata is written in the " kiki " ( kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) and nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) ) with various chinese characters .
** summary
it is written in the " kojiki " that ' these mihashira no kami ( three goddesses ) are the three great goddesses before which munakata no kimi worships . '
therefore , they were gods worshipped by groups of fishermen such as the munakata clan .
because of the closer relationship that developed with korea , the three goddesses , who were native and local deities , came to be worshipped as national deities after the fifth century .
** according to the japanese mythology found in the " kiki , " amaterasu gave birth to them after she received totsuka no tsurugi ( the sword ten hands long ) of susanoo upon making a vow of amaterasu and susanoo .
because they were born from monozane ( media from which gods are born ) they are considered to be susanoo ' s children .
** the place upon which they descended is a mountain called mt . mutsuga-take in kurate-machi , kurate-gun , located at the eastern edge of the munakata area of fukuoka prefecture .
** based on this , the three goddesses descended to their respective places where they exist today , and where they are worshipped .

** kukurihimenokami
** summary
** kukurihime depicted in fiction
** kukurihimenokami is a japanese deity .
she is identified with shirayamahimenokami , who is enshrined at hakusan in kaga and other hakusan-jinja shrines throughout the nation .
** in japanese mythology , she appears neither in kojiki ( the record of ancient matters ) nor in the text of nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) and appears only once in the issho ( a book cited in nihonshoki ) of nihonshoki .
according to this document , izanagi visited yomi ( the world after death ) to see izanami during the process of the birth of deities , but he run away after seeing izanami who was dead and cold .
however , izanami caught up with him at yomotsuhirasaka and they squabbled there .
then , yomotsuchimoribito appeared there and conveyed izanami ' s message saying ' i cannot follow you . '
when kukurihimenokami said something , izanagi offered praise and went home .
nothing is written about what kukurihimenokami said and there is no description of her place of birth , etc .
based on this anecdote , kukurihimenokami is regarded as a deity of match-making since she reconciled izanagi and izanami .
further , she is also said to be a goddess of shaman ( a miko ( shrine maiden ) ) because she reconciled the deceased ( izanami ) and the living ( izanagi ) .
she is also regarded as a deity who takes away impurities .
** her deity name ' kukuri ' means ' bind ' and this deity name is believed to have been derived from the anecdote in which she reconciled izanagi and izanami .
** the details concerning the reason why she came to be identified with shirayamahimenokami are not clear .
concerning the enshrined deity of shirayamahime-jinja shrine ( hakusan city , ishikawa prefecture ) , the head shrine of the hakusa-jinja shrines , only izanagi and izanami were referred to in books written up to the medieval period .
** during the era of synthesis of shinto and buddhism , shirayamahimenokami was called either hakusan-daigongen , hakusan-myori-gongen , or hakusan-myori-bosatsu , and the honji-butsu ( the original buddhist divinity ) was called the 00-faced kannon ( the goddess of mercy ) .
** currently shirayamahime-jinja shrine enshrines , together with izanagi and izanami , kukurihimenokami ( shirayamahimenokami ) as its principal deities .
** in fiction , kukurihime is often depicted as a mysterious being because little is known about her .
** further , there are some works in which a character reflects the image of kukurihimenokami by using a portion of her name .
** konohana no sakuya-bime
** konohana no sakuya-bime is a goddess that appears in japanese mythology .
in general , her name is written as 木花咲耶姫 .
her name is written as 木花之佐久夜毘売 in the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and as 木花開耶姫 in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
she is also called konohana sakuya-bime , konohana sakuya-hime or simply as sakuya-hime .
her real name is kamuatatsu-hime ( 神阿多都比売 ) in the " kojiki " and kayatsu-hime ( 鹿葦津姫 or 葦津姫 ) in " nihonshoki , " and konohana no sakuya-bime is used as an alternate name .
** she was a daughter of oyamatsumi , and iwanaga-hime was her older sister .
as ninigi ' s wife she gave birth to hoderi ( umisachihiko ) , hosuseri and hoori ( yamasachihiko ) .
** description in the mythology
she met ninigi , who had descended in the province of himuka upon tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) at kasasa no misaki ( cape kasasa ) , and he proposed her to marry him .
her father , oyamatsumi , was very happy about the news , and he offered him her older sister , iwanaga-hime also .
however , ninigi married only konohana no sakuya-bime and he sent home iwanaga-hime , who was ugly .
that is why emperors , who are his descendants , do not live as long as the gods ( refer to the section " konohana no sakuya-bime and iwanaga-hime " in " tensonkorin " ) .
** konohana no sakuya-bime became pregnant overnight , and ninigi suspected that the child belonged to kunitsukami ( god of the land ) .
in order to disprove his suspicion she made a pledge and then went into the birthing room .
she said that if her child was truly ninigi ' s , then the child would be born safely no matter what , and she set fire on the birthing room .
she gave birth to mihashira no ko ( three children ) , hoderi , hosuseri and hoori , in the fire ( refer to the section " konohana no sakuya-bime giving birth " in " tensonkorin " ) .
emperor jinmu was the grandson of hoori .
** description
konohana no sakuyabime means a woman as beautiful as flowers blossoming on a tree ( cherry tree flowers ) .
it is considered that that ' ata ' in kamuatatsu-hime comes from ata-go , ata-no-kori , satsuma province ( the vicinity of present-day minamisatsuma city , kagoshima prefecture ) .
that is , she was from ata hayato , and the name means the daughter of the chieftain of the area .
** it is considered that konohana no sakuya-bime and kamuatatsu-hime were originally separate deities .
the story of konohana no sakuya-bime and iwanaga-hime tells about the ephemerality of life and the origin of death , and this is one variation of banana-type mythology often seen in various areas around southeast asia .
upon inserting the story of this banana-type mythology , it can be considered that the task was given to kamuatatsu-hime , who was a daughter to oyamatsumi .
** worship
because she gave birth in fire she became a fire goddess , and she is enshrined at mt . fuji , which is a volcano .
however , according to the legend passed down at fujisan hongu sengen-taisha shrine konohana no sakuya-bime is a goddess of water .
she was enshrined at mt . fuji in order to bring volcanic eruptions under control .
in addition , from this story , she is viewed as a goddess who protects one ' s wife , a goddess of safe delivery of a baby as well as a goddess of child rearing .
** furthermore , there is a story of oyamatsumi making amano tamukezake , which is present-day amazake ( sweet , mild sake ) , using the heavily fruited head of rice plant from sanada when hoori was born .
therefore , oyamatsumi is called sakatoke no kami and konohana no sakuya-bime is called sakatokeko no kami , and they are considered to be deities of sake brewing .
** her father , oyamatsumi , is a god that represented all the mountains .
she inherited mt . fuji from her father , the tallest and the most beautiful mountain in japan .
she is enshrined in this mountain and protects the eastern part of japan .
** in addition to being the enshrined deity of mt . fuji at fujisan hongu sengen-taisha shrine ( fujinomiya city , shizuoka prefecture ) , she is also enshrined at sengen-jinja shrines all over japan .
in addition , she is enshrined as a goddess of safe delivery and child rearing at koyasu-jinja shrine ( shokansha ( shrine where the gods of clothing , food and housing are worshipped ) at kotai-jingu shrine in hachioji city , tokyo , for example ) .
she is also enshrined as sakatokekonokami at umenomiya-taisha shrine ( ukyo ward , kyoto prefecture ) .

** futodama
** futodama is a god that appears in japanese mythology .
he is considered to be the main ancestor of the inbe clan ( 忌部氏 ) ( later the inbe clan ( 斎部氏 ) ) .
** description in mythology
his birth is not mentioned in the kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) , but in kogoshui it is commented that he was a son of takamimusubi .
** at the occasion of ama no iwato ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , in the heavenly rock cave ) omoikane came up with a plan to get amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) out of the cave .
he conducted futomani ( scapulimancy ) with amenokoyane no mikoto in order to read whether the plan was sound or not .
** upon tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) he was ordered to descend with ninigi , and he accompanied him as one of itsutomonoo ( five deities later to become ancestral deities of the five clans ) .
in arufumi ( supplement volumes of explanatory notes in nihonshoki ) of nihonshoki it is written that he , along with amenokoyane , was ordered to become a protector of the shrine that enshrines amaterasu ( ise-jingu shrine ) .
** explanation
along with amenokoyane ( ancestor , worshipped as a god , of the nakatomi clan ) he is a god of rituals .
** according to the kiki , amenokoyane rather than futodama , played a more important role at iwatogakure ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami in the heavenly rock cave ) .
this reflects the power balance between the inbe clan and the nakatomi clan when the kiki was written .
according to kogoshui written by inbe no hironari of the inbe clan , futodama plays a more central role instead .
** worship
he is worshipped as a god of divination and shinto rituals .
he is enshrined at futodamanomikoto-jinja shrine ( kashihara city , nara prefecture ) , oasahiko-jinja shrine ( naruto city , tokushima prefecture ) , awa-jinja shrine ( tateyama city , chiba prefecture ) and ohara -jinja shrine ( kimitsu city , chiba prefecture ) .
** ameno tajikarao
** ameno tajikarao is a god that appears in japanese mythology ( shinto religion ) .
kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) is written " 天手力男神 " in chinese characters and nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) is written " 天手力雄神 . "
** mythological description
as the result brightness returned in the world .
** amaterasu infused deities of omoikane ( the god of wisdom and talent ) , tajikarao , and amanoiwatowake no kami into the three sacred treasures of the imperial family during its tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) .
since then ameno tajikarao is believed to have been enshrined in sana no agata , ise province .
** explanation
ameno tajikarao , whose name means ' a male god having strong arms , ' representing physical strength or muscular strength .
** worship
** a legend connected to togakushi-jinja shrine goes that the rock of the cave thrown by tajikarao fell on mt . togakushi , shiga province .
** tajikarao enshrined in oyama-jinja shrine is a god of shugen on mt . tateyama .
oyama-jinja shrine and togakushi-jinja shrine have their origins in mountain worship , which shows that tajikarao is related to mountain worship .
this belief was connected to a buddhist concept of hell and developed into a mountain worship in and after the heian period .
the ama no iwato ( cave of heaven ) that ameno tajikarao opened wide can be associated with the border of a different world existing in a mountain .
this is because tajikarao was associated with mountains .
** the popular image of the deity tajikarao is one of a god with phenomenal physical strength and he appears in many kagura ( sacred music and dancing performed at shrines ) performed around japan .
** ishikoridome
** ishikoridome is a god appearing in the japanese mythology .
she was regarded as an ancestral deity of kagami zukuri no muraji ( the mirror-making clans ) .
** descriptions in mythology
in the story of ama no iwato ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , in the heavenly rock cave ) , she created the mirror of yata ( the eight-span mirror : one of the imperial regalia ) .
incidentally , the hinokuma-jingu and kunikakasu-jingu shrines ( wakayama city ) keep the mirrors of higata and hiboko created prior to the mirror of yata .
the mirror of higata and the mirror of hiboko are shintai ( an object of worship housed in a shinto shrine in which the spirit of a deity is traditionally believed to dwell ) of the hinokuma-jingu shrine and the kunikakasu-jingu shrine respectively .
** explanation

** tamanooya no mikoto was a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
he was an ancestral deity of tamatsukuribe ( the jewel-making clans ) .
he appears only in kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) .
a deity of this name does not appear in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) while there appears an identical deity .
** descriptions in mythology
at the time of iwatogakure ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , in the heavenly rock cave ) , he created yasakani no magatama ( the jewel of yasakani ) .
** as both are regarded as ancestral deities of the jewel-making clans , they are probably identical to tamanooya no mikoto .
** explanation
the name of this deity means an ancestral deity of the jewel-making clans as well as a maker of magatama ( a comma-shaped bead ) .
** he is enshrined in the tamanooya-jinja shrine ( hofu city , yamaguchi prefecture ) , ishitsukuri tamatsukuri-jinja shrine ( ika-gun , shiga prefecture ) , etc .
** iwanaga-hime

** according to the " nihonshoki " chronicles , iwanaga-hime put a curse on the pregnant konohanano sakuya bime , which caused human life to become shorter .
** explanation
iwanaga-hime represents the eternity of a rock .
the story of konohanano sakuya bime and iwanaga-hime is a distorted myth called a banana myth .
in the story , a stone is transformed into a woman whose name includes the character for stone .
** based on the story above , she is worshipped as a deity of eternal youth and immortality .
izu-jinja shrine ( gifu city ) is cited as an example of the small number of shrines that are dedicated only to iwanaga-hime .
sengen-jinja shrines all over the country are dedicated to iwanaga-hime together with konohanano sakuya bime .
** yui-no-yashiro shrine of kibune-jinja shrine is dedicated to her as the god of marriage ( matchmaking ) , cupid .
there is iwanagahime-jinja shrine in amagasaki city , hyogo prefecture , which is related to kifune-jinja shrine and has a short history .

kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) describes him as 和久産巣日神 ( wakumusubi no kami ) while nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) describes him as 稚産霊 ( wakumusubi ) .
** in kojiki , at the creation of deities , he was born from the urine of izanami ( the shinto goddess who gave birth to japan ) , who got burnt and fell ill after giving birth to kagutsuchi , the god of fire .
toyouke-bime was born between wakumusubi and mitsuhanome , the god of water , who was also born from the same urine .
** at his birth , silkworms and mulberry leaves appeared on his head , and the five main cereals were produced in his navel , so he was regarded as the god of food-origin stories in the japanese mythology such as ogetsu-hime in kojiki and ukemochi in nihonshoki .
** the word ' waku ' used in his name means youthfulness , and ' musubi ' means creation , signifying the god of governing grain growth .
he is worshiped as the god of the five main cereals and sericulture , and often enshrined together with other gods of food .
** kushinadahime
** kushinadahime is a goddess that appears in japanese mythology ( shinto religion ) .
" kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) gives her name as " 櫛名田比売 " in chinese characters and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) gives it as " 奇稲田姫 . "
** mythological description
she appears in a setsuwa ( anecdotes ) about yamatanoorochi ( eight-forked-snake ) .
among eight daughters of ashinazuchi and tenazuchi , she was the last to leave them for marriage and became the wife of susano ( deity in japanese mythology ) .
** having been exiled from takamanohara and arriving in izumo , susano met the couple ashinazuchi and tenazuchi , who each year had daughters who were taken and eaten by a beast called yamatanoorochi ( eight-forked-snake ) .
he promised to kill the yamatanoorochi in return for being given kushinadahime .
after killing the yamatanoorochi , susano searched for a place to live in with kushinadahime and built a palace in suga .
** some suggest that susano was exiled from a country outside hinokuni ( or korean peninsula ) .
** explanation
her name is generally interpreted as " 奇し稲田姫 , " which means a mysterious goddess of rice fields as nihonshoki describes .
although some give different chinese characters like " 串蛇 , " this interpretation is believed to be incorrect .
others suggest that yamatanoorochi was the god of a river and that she was originally a shrine maiden serving the god by giving her name a chinese character meaning comb and depicting her as a shrine maiden wearing a comb .
** she is mentioned in chapter iishi-gun of " izumo no kuni fudoki " ( the topography of izumo province ) under the name of kushiinadamitoyomanura-hime .
** many of these shrines are dedicated to her along with her husband , susano and descent ( or son ) , okuninushi .
** fukuoka city , fukuoka prefecture has kushida-jinja shrine but it is dedicated to ohatanushi no okami , amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) , and susano no omikami .
however some suggest that kushinadahime was originally enshrined in it .
** kuninotokotachi no kami
** kuninotokotachi no kami is a god appearing in japanese mythology .
the name is written 国之常立神 in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) and 国常立尊 in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
also known as kuninosokotachi no mikoto .
** it is a god who appeared during the creation of heaven and earth ( japanese mythology ) .
it was the first god to appear as kaminoyonanayo ( seven generations of the gods ' world , the primordial seven ) in kojiki , and was the counterpart of amenotokotachi no kami , the last of the kotoamatsu kami ( literally , separate heavenly kami ) .
it is recorded that it was a hitorigami ( god without gender ) and never appeared in public .
in the main body of nihonshoki , kuninotokotachi no mikoto was described as the first god to appear , and that it was a male god .
in other arufumi ( supplement volumes of explanatory notes in nihonshoki ) , it is also described as the first or second god that appeared .
there were no further setsuwa ( anecdotes ) in either the kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) .
** since it was described as the first god to appear in nihonshoki , as well as the first of the kaminoyonanayo in kojiki , it was valued among shinto theorists as the source god , root god , and original god .
in yoshida shinto , which was influenced by this , kuninotokotachi no kami was considered the same god as ame no minakanushi no kami , and was positioned as daigen-sonshin ( root god of the universe ) .
kuninotokotachi no kami is viewed as an important god in the various sect shinto schools descending from this .
** it is worshipped as the root god of nation forming and the guardian god of national land , and is enshrined in the following shrines .
** sanno-jinja shrine ( kanegasaki-cho , isawa-gun , iwate prefecture )

** kotoshiro nushi
** kotoshiro nushi ( a japanese ancient god ) is a god that appears in japanese mythology ( shinto religion ) .
it is also known as yaekotoshironushi no kami .
** mythological description
he was born to okuninushi and kamuyatate-hime .
** when okuninushi was requested by takemikazuchi to hand over the land at ashihara no nakatsukuniheitei , okuninushi replied that his son , kotoshiro nushi ( a japanese ancient god ) was away fishing at mihogasaki cape and would reply .
then takemikazuchi went to mihogasaki cape to request kotoshiro nushi to hand over control of the land .
kotoshiro nushi answered in the affirmative , then tilted the boat with his foot , slapped his hands upside down to transform the boat into a fresh brushwood fence and hid himself in it .
** upon hearing that takeminakata also gave in to takemikazuchi , okuninushi agreed to hand over the land saying that his 000 children would not disobey amatsu kami ( god of heaven ) if kotoshiro nushi was the leader .
** explanation
his name ' kotoshiro ' literally means ' knowing words ' and he is a god that took charge of takusen ( oracle ) .
koto in his name can be written in the chinese character " 言 " ( words ) or " 事 " ( events ) , because there was no distinction between words and events in ancient times .
** believed to be a son of okuninushi , kotoshiro nushi is said to have originally come not from izumo , but from yamato .
he became a mythical god in izumo known for giving away control of the land .
he was originally a god of paddy fields in katsuragi and assumed the status of a god of oracles by taking over part of the status of hitokoto nushi ( a japanese ancient god ) .
this is why kotoshiro nushi held an important position in katsuragi dynasty and is regarded as one of the mikannagi hasshin .
** there is a legend that kotoshiro nushi , who shut himself up in aofushigaki in miho , became mishima-myojin ( the deity of mishima-jinja shrine ) in miyake-jima island one of the seven islands of izu .
the legend also says that he was enshrined in present-day mishima-taisha shrine ( mishima city , shizuoka prefecture ) after producing 00 islands together with the god of mt . fuji .
** worship
he is regarded not only as a god of oracles but also as a lover of fishing and is identical to ebisu ( god of fishing and commerce ) because he was fishing during the story of giving away control of the land .
he was also worshiped as the sea god and a god of commerce .
the deity ebisu , one of the seven deities of good luck , carries a big sea bream under his arm while holding a fishing rod , and originates in the story of handing over control of the land .
** he is also enshrined in shrines that are dedicated to ebisu such as miho-jinja shrine ( matsue city , shimane prefecture ) , nagata-jinja shrine ( nagata ward , kobe city ) as well as imamiya-ebisu-jinja shrine ( naniwa ward osaka prefecture ) .
** however , the name of imamiya-ebisu-jinja shrine suggests that ' imamiya ' is originally an abbreviation of ' ima nishinomiya . '
therefore it is natural that its enshrined deity was hiruko like nishinomiya-jinja shrine , which presents itself as the ebisu sohongu shrine .
** jichin-sai ( ground-breaking ceremony )
** jichin-sai in buddhism
** the flow of a jichin-sai
** naorai ( feast )
** the shinto ceremony differs from the buddhist one .
generally , it is recognized as a ceremony that seeks the blessing of the god in order to ensure the safety of the construction work , and it is sometimes called anzen-kigan-sai ( a ceremony performed to pray for safety ) .
it is also referred to as chinji-sai , tsuchi-matsuri , chi-matsuri , and ji-iwai .
** offerings such as sake , water , rice , salt , vegetables , and fish are placed on the altar .
in certain areas like kansai , sand or salt is sometimes brought from the beach near ise-jingu shrine and put in the four corners of the stand .
this five-colored silk represents the five elements that form all things in the universe in the gogyo-setsu ( the theory of the five elements ) , that is , tree , fire , soil , metal , and water .
** in the case of mikkyo ( esoteric buddhism ) , there is a rite called chintaku-fudo-ho which is carried out with fudo myoo ( the god of fire ) as the principal image .
** in the case of buildings like a temple , there is a rite named chindan-ho , which is held to calm the dirt mound before laying a wooden floor , and jichin ( calming the land ) and chindan ( calming the mound ) are performed separately .
informally , however , they are sometimes carried out together .
a kenbyo ( a wise jar ) containing goho ( five treasures , or gems ) , shichiho ( seven treasures , or gems ) , etc . is buried in the center of the mound .
a flat stone called chinseki is placed on top , and it is never moved even when reconstruction is undertaken .
rings , piles , and five crystal balls are buried in all directions .
** the general flow of a jichin-sai is as follows .
** shubatsu ( purification )
a ritual whereby the attendants and the offerings are purified in advance of the ceremony .
** koshin ( calling down the god )

** jichin ( appeasing the god of the land )
karisome ( the act of mowing the grass ) , ugachizome ( the act of leveling the land ) , kuwaire ( the act of plowing the land ) , and the like are performed .
they are often divided among the architect , the builder , and the client .
** tamagushi-hoten ( the offering of a tamagushi )

" tamagushi " is a sprig of the sakaki tree that is decorated with shide ( zigzag paper streamers ) .
** tessen ( the removal of the offerings )

** a naorai ( a feast ) is held at the end of the jichin-sai .
** in the ceremonial site , the attendants of the ceremony have a toast with omiki ( sacred sake ) and eat the offerings that were withdrawn .
** kamidana
** kamidana in budo-dojos ( martial arts training halls )
** altars set up for the sakazuki-goto events ( sharing of sake from a single cup as a pledge of the boss-henchman relationship ) of the yakuza ( the japanese mafia ) ( bakuto ( gamblers ) , tekiya ( crooked peddlers ) )
** a " kamidana " ( a household shinto altar ) is a shelf used to enshrine the shinto gods ( shinto ) at home , in office , and in other places .
** types
kamidana has three types .
this is called a fudamiya ( literally , " a shrine for a talisman ) , and it is referred to as a kamidana in a narrow sense .
there is also a kamidana that enshrines a ' goshintai ' ( an object of worship that is believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) , which carries a strong sense of the abode of a deity , instead of a shinsatsu .
there is a point of view that in such a case it is more natural to consider it a spin-off of the shrine that has given it the ' goshintai ' than to regard it as a kamidana .
in what follows , explanations are offered concerning a fudamiya ( a narrowly defined kamidana ) .
** installation site
a kamidana is set up facing south or east near the ceiling of the top floor ( or a part of the ceiling above which the upper story does not have a floor ) of a room that is as bright and clean as possible .
when it is difficult to be installed on the top floor , it is put in below a piece of paper on which the letter of ' ten ' ( the sky ) or ' kumo ' ( a cloud ) is written .
although most miyagata to which shinsatsu are offered have one or three spots into which they are put , some large-sized kamidana have more than five or seven .
in the case that there are three spaces , the shinsatsu of the ise-jingu shrine ( a taima ) is dedicated in the center , that of the ujigami in the right facing the kamidana , and that of the other revered shrine in the left .
in the case that there is one place , three shinsatsu are put together in the following order from the front : the shinsatsu of the ise-jingu shrine , that of the ujigami , and that of the revered shrine .
** shingu ( ritual articles )
a shinkyo ( literally , " a sacred mirror " ) , sakaki ( sacred evergreens ) , and tomyo ( votive lights ) are arranged in front of the kamidana , and shimenawa ( sacred rice straw ropes ) are hung in front of them .
it is also not uncommon to see different good luck charms ( a hamaya ( a decorative arrow supposed to ward off evil ) , a rake , and others ) displayed in each household .
** shinsen ( osonae ( offerings ) )
rinsed rice ( or boiled rice ) , salt , water , and sake are basic to shinsen , but fruit and vegetables , raw fish , dried fish , confectioneries , and others are also offered .
in addition , the acceptance letter , the noshigami ( wrapping paper for a present ) enclosing the celebration gift , and so forth are sometimes dedicated .
** the arrangement of shinsen is as follows when there are rice , salt , and water : water , rice , and salt from the left facing the kamidana or water and salt from the left in the first row and rice in the second .
** the food offered to the god is later eaten as ' osagari ' ( offerings withdrawn ) .
** worship
it is desirable for the entire family together to thank the god for his constant divine protection and pray for future safety and happiness following the presentation of shinsen , but when this is not possible each member may offer a prayer before going out .
** a kamidana is placed in many martial arts dojos , but in the edo period it was not a kamidana but a kamidoko ( an alcove in which a kakejiku ( a hanging scroll ) is hung ) that was installed .
** after gekiken ( renamed kendo after kenjutsu ) and jujutsu ( later changed to judo ) were introduced to extracurricular lessons in junior high school under the old education system in 0000 , what was installed in martial arts dojos became a kamidana .
the japanese national flag was hoisted below it , and keiko ( practice ) was performed in the form of shinzen-keiko ( practice according to shinto rites ) which included worshipping to enter the dojo .
when budo ( martial arts ) was resumed after being forbidden in school education by the general headquarters following the world war ii , the kamidana was removed from many public school dojos based on the separation of religion and state .
while it remains in some public and many private schools , it is not set up in public judo or kendo training halls when they are newly built .
** the altars established for the sakazuki-goto events of the organized groups of gangsters look similar in form to the kamidoko placed in budo-dojos , but they do not fall under the kamidana category as they are not permanent .
** umashiashikabihikoji
** umashiashikabihikoji is a god appearing in japanese mythology .
it was one of the kotoamatsu kami ( literally , separate heavenly kami ) ( japanese mythology ) appearing during the creation of heaven and earth .
it is written umashiashikabihikoji no kami ( 宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神 ) in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) , and umashiashikabihikoji no mikoto ( 可美葦牙彦舅尊 ) in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** in other words , it is the fourth god .
it is not described in the main body of the nihonshoki .
it is described as the first god to appear in the arufumi ( supplement volumes of explanatory notes in nihonshoki ) vol . 0 and 0 , and the second god to appear in the arufumi vol . 0 .
it is a hitorigami ( god without gender ) who is described as having gone into hiding immediately , with no comment on the circumstances , and does not appear in japanese mythology thereafter .
** the word ' umashi ' in the shinmei ( name of god ) is a eulogistic name for something good , as in ' umashi-kuni . '
the word ' ashi ' is reed , ' kabi ' is cognate with mold , meaning something that ferments and buds .
here , ' ashikabi ' means the ' reed buds . '
thus , it is a god deifying the vitality of all things symbolized by reed buds .
in general , it is considered a god of vitality .
** the word ' hikoji ' means a male , but this god is a hitorigami and has no gender .
it is believed that due to the vigor of reeds budding , it was considered the ' god of yang , ' influenced by the cosmic dual forces ideology introduced from china , and the word ' hiko ' which is indicative of male was included in the shinmei .
** it is enshrined in the honden ( main shrine ) okyaku-za of izumo-taisha shrine ( izumo city , shimane prefecture ) , ukishima-jinja shrine ( toon city , ehime prefecture ) , etc .
** kami ( shinto )
** kami that have come into existence as the result of the transformation of natural entities or phenomena into kami .
** kami that have come into existence as the result of the deification of an abstraction such as a concept or an evil .
** kami that have come into existence by the deification of ancient leaders or influential personages .
** the creator of all things
** all-powerful emperors as the creators and rulers of all things
** kami ( the emperor ) as ' divine ' according to the theory of the divine right of kings .
** names of kami
** ame ' no ( attibutes of kami )
** uzume ' no ( name of kami )
** mikoto ' ( title of the kami )
** the word ' kami '
** the " kami " found in shinto are objects of faith that are to be feared or held in awe .
yaoyorozu ( 0 million ) ' appearing in the expression ' yaoyorozu no kami ' is an example of a large number .
** types of kami
** while shinto ' s multitude of kami are ' humanized divinities ' who have the same form and attributes as humans , they are also ' guardian gods ' that bestow blessings on the living ; however , such kami are also capable of tormenting or harassing the living .
( refer to ' to curse ' ) it is precisely because of this capacity to cause disasters and other misfortunes that kami are to be feared .
kami in shinto are intimately related to the ability to curse human beings .
** generally speaking , kami can be categorized as follows .
** 0 . kami that have come into existence as a result of the transformation of a natural entity or phenomenon into a kami .
** 0 . conceptual kami that have come into existence as a result of the transformation of an abstract entity such as a concept or misfortune into a kami .
** 0 . kami that are thought to be deified individuals that have come into existence as a result of the deification of ancient leaders , influential personages and the like ( euhemerism ) .
** 0 . the three kami that are the creators of all things ( referred to below as the three creator deities ) .
** 0 . the all-powerful emperors , who are the creators and rulers of all things .
** 0 . emperors are kami that in the sense that monarchs are considered ' divine ' according to the " theory of the divine right of kings " .
** the oldest among the above-described types of kami are those that have come into existence as the result of the transformation of natural entities or phenomena into kami .
this sense remains as a fundamental underpinning of shinto to this day , and yakumo koizumi maintains that this is ' the sensibility of shinto ' .
nature bestows benefits onto humankind , and from time to time also presents hazards to humankind .
these natural entities and phenomona later came to be called ' kami ' .
** at present , as a result of the proclamation by emperor showa after wwii that he was a human being and not a god , the role of the emperor in the political realm , and the relationship of the emperor to the people has changed .
however , within the institutional confines of the shinto religion , the existence of the emperor as bloodline descendent of the sun goddess , amaterasu omikami , still occupies an important position , and the emperor is positioned at the summit of the religious beliefs and practices .
** each of the various tribes worshiped its individual unique kami .
interaction among the tribes brought about the fusion of each of the tribal kami , whereby the kami were metamorphosized .
shamanism from the north also exerted an influence .
there are scholars who refer to these phenomona as ' kamigami shugo ' ( fusion of the gods ) .
they maintain that this fusion of the gods phenomona laid the foundation for the later introduction of kami from other religions , starting with buddhism .
** number 0 is kami that atsutane hirata , who had been influenced by banned books related to christianity , assigned the position of creator of all things to amenominakanushi no kami .
his thought formed the foundation of the anti-foreigner ideology of the royalist faction , as exemplified by the slogan ' revere the emperor and expel the barbarians ' ( ' sonno joi ' ) , which exerted a strong influence on each of the sects of modern sect shinto .
amenominakanushi no kami ( god ruling the center of heaven ) , takamimusubi no kami , and kamimusubi no kami became the three creator deities .
the three creator deities are treated as the supreme kami in many types of restoration shinto even today .
among these three creator deities , amenominakanushi no kami is assigned the highest position .
** in " saishu senso ron/senso-shi dairon " written by kanji ishiwara ( originally delivered as part of the ' kowa yoko ' ( the outlines of pacification ) in china at changchun in july 0000 ) , the following descriptions are found .
when humankind first awakened to belief in an arahitogami ( a kami who appears in this world in human form ) , the true value of civilization based on the rule of virtue ( the way of kings ) is shown forth for the first time .
it was on the basis of this ideology that ishiwara , who was a staff officer in the kwantung army ( japanese armed forces in manchukuo ) , incited the outbreak of the manchurian incident .
refer to the preceding and following entries .
** number six was used as the interpretation of ' arahitogami ' in the proclamation ( imperial edict ) in english made by emperor showa in 0000 , in which he declares that he is a human being , not a god .
** the names ( shinmei ) of shinto kami can generally be said to consist of three parts .
take the case of ame no uzume no mikoto , for example .
** ame ' no
** uzume ' no
** mikoto '
** are the three parts .
** in addition to these three parts , a variety of words and phrases honoring kami can be added to this name .
for example , the formal name of the kami usually called ' ninigi ' is ' amenigishiku ninigishi amatsuhiko hiko hononinigi no mikoto ' .
** there are cases in which the kami is addressed with the first part of the shinmei omitted .
also , in the case of academic research , such as in the fields of folklorology , mythology and the like , the third part of the shinmei is often omitted when referring to kami .
** the first part ( prefix ) of the shinmei indicates attributes of the kami .
the most frequent prefix used in shinmei , ' ame ' , ' ama ' ( heaven ) indicates amatsukami , or kami related to the heavens or takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
the prefix ' kuni ' indicates kunitsukami ; however , in contrast to the many kami having a shinmei prefixed with ' ame ' , a shinmei prefixed with ' kuni ' designates a kami associated with the land or the country .
the prefix ' yomo ' ( land of the deceased ) indicates a kami from yominokuni , ' ho ' ( ear/head of a plant ) indicates a kami related to rice ear .
there are many shinmei that do not include a prefix .
** the second part of the shimei is the name proper of the kami .
upon close examination , it becomes apparent that there are many shinmei that end in the same sound .
these can also be thought to be the names that each of the tribes called their respective ' kami ' before the fusion of the kami .
the syllable ' mi ' indicates the shinmei of a higher level kami than the syllable ' chi ' .
the syllables ' nushi ' ( owner , master ) and ' ushi ' ( adult ) are appended to the names of high level kami , as in the cases of oohirumenomuchi ( an alternative name for amaterasu ) , okuni nushi , and so on .
in particular , there are many cases in which a shinmei appended with ' me ' indicates a shrine maiden who has been deified .
** the third part of the shinmei is called the shingo .
it is a so-called honorific title .
the most prevalent examples are ' kami ' and ' mikoto ' .
mikoto ' means a ' honourable task ' , that is to say , an order , and is appended to the shinmei of kami that have received some kind of an order .
for example , the shingo of izanagi and izanami at the time of their appearance was ' kami ' .
upon receiving an order from kotoamatsukami to ' solidify a country ' , their shingo changed to ' mikoto ' .
however , in the nihonshoki all shingo have been unified as 0mikoto ' .
the character used to rite " mikoto " is the character for ' exalted ' for paricularly sacred kami , and the character for ' order ' for other kami .
for particularly exalted kami , the shingo " okami " or omikami " is used .
in addition , later eras saw the addition of myojin , gongen , and so on .
** the word ' kami ' in the japanese language was originally a word used to indicate a deity in the shinto religion .
however , in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) it is already possible to see descriptions of buddhist deities as ' banjin ' ( foreign deities ) .
however , with the onset of the meiji period , the christian god was also interpreted as being a ' kami ' .
** controversely , in other countries , when the kami of the shinto religion are discussed , in many cases they are grouped together as ' kami ' , and distinguished from other deities , and the corresponding english language page on wikipedia is also entitled , ' kami ' .

** tsunugaarashito
** amenohiboko is a deity in japanese mythology , who appears in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
he was a prince of silla ( an ancient korean kingdom ) .
** his great-grandson was tajimamori , a deity of sweets .
tajimamori ' s daughter was katsuraginotakanukahime no mikoto , the mother of okinagatarashihime no mikoto ( empress jingu ) .
additionally , some say that amenohiboko might have been connected to koko , a japanese retainer believed to have served korean kings and help them found silla .
** in any event , his name , which contains the chinese character of ' 天 ' ( heaven ) , suggests that he may have been closely connected to the ancestors of the imperial family ( just like deities in takamanohara ( heaven ) ) .
there was no other prince from foreign countries whose name contained the chinese character of ' 天 . '
** kojiki describes amenohiboko as follows ;
a long time ago , in silla , a woman was taking a nap near a pond called " agunuma . "
then , a ray of sunlight fell on her private parts like a rainbow .
immediately , she became pregnant and gave birth to a red jewel .
a man , who was watching this , pleaded with her to give him the jewel , received it from her , and carried it with him all the time .
one day , he met amenohiboko when carrying food to a mountain using a ox .
hiboko , who assumed that the man was going to kill and eat the ox , arrested him to put him in jail .
the man tried to explain however hiboko would not forgive him .
so , he showed him the red jewel that he had been carrying all the time .
in exchange for the jewel , he was finally pardoned .
when he brought the jewel back home and put it on the floor , it turned into a beautiful lady .
** he made her his lawful wife , and she served delicious dishes for him every day .
one day , however , hiboko became arrogant and bitterly badmouthed her .
frustrated , his wife ran away from him , saying that she would go back to her parents ' country .
she arrived at himegoso-jinja shrine ( higashinari ward , osaka city , now shitateruhime , a daughter of okuninushi , is enshrined ) near naniwa tsu ( today ' s osaka port ) by boat .
hiboko , who was repentant , came all the way to japan , chasing his wife .
his wife ' s name was akaru hime .
but he could not meet her in the end because the deity that ruled the naniwa straits was in the way .
he came ashore on a beach in tajima province , and eventually , got married to a local girl , maetsumi .
** in spring ( march ) of the third year of emperor suinin ' s reign , amenohiboko , a prince from silla came to japan .
he brought with him eight kinds of sacred treasures : hafuto-no-tama jewels , ashitaka-no-tama jewels , red stones , swords , pikes , mirrors , and kuma no himorogi ( a temporarily erected sacred space or an altar used as a locus of worship ) .
he finally reached deishi in tajima province after travelling though harima , omi , and wakasa provinces , and settled there , making a local girl , matao , his wife .
** these treasures might have been the tools of korean settlers for worshipping the sun god .
his name , ' hiboko , ' itself means a pike , which was used in rituals to worship the sun god .
the pike was also considered to be yorishiro ( an object a divine spirit resides in ) .
the province mentioned here came under strong influence from korean settlers .
in tajima province where hiboko settled , he has been believed to be the deity of land development and still deeply worshipped by people .
this helps us conclude that amenohiboko was a deity worshipped by korean settlers in deishi .
** these treasures are enshrined as deities in izushi-jinja shrine ( izushi-cho , toyooka city , hyogo prefecture ) , together with amenohiboko .
all of these were tools used to pray for the wind and waves in the ocean to die down .
this represents a combined form of faith in the sea god by people who lived and worked on the seas and worship for amenohiboko .
** in harima no kuni-fudoki , amenohiboko is referred to as amenohiboko no mikoto and described as a deity who came from a foreign country and settled in japan in the age of the gods .
he fought over the land with ashiharashikoo no mikoto ( 葦原志挙乎命 ) ( ashiharashikoo no mikoto ( 葦原志許乎命 ) ) , who are enshrined in iwa-jinja shrine .
( both of them were regarded as identical to okuninushi ( the chief god of izumo in southern honshu island , japan ) . )
the descriptions of ages and whether there was contention or not in the fudoki are not necessarily consistent with those of kojiki or nihonshoki .
** in this fudoki , contention is described in the local tales of ibo , shiso , and kanzaki counties .
they put an end to the contention by leaving the decision to the result obtained by throwing three black ivy vines .
the result was that one of the three vines thrown by ashiharashikoo no mikoto fell in harima and the rest fell in tajima , whereas all of the three vines thrown by amenohiboko no mikoto dropped in tajima .
this forced amenohiboko to retreat to deishi , tajima .
as his name , ' boko ' ( = ' hiko , ' meaning a pike ) , suggests , amenohiboko-no-mikoto was related to iron-making .
this may imply that there was contention for iron between indigenous and foreign people .
** according to " nihonshoki , " tsunugaarashito , a prince of kaya ( an ancient korean kingdom ) came to japan before amenohiboko .
in it , he is depicted as the hero of the tale mentioned here earlier , who came all the way to japan to chase his wife , akaruhime .
but he is said to have returned to his country after three years in japan .
additionally , according to " shinsen shojiroku " ( newly compiled register of clan names and titles of nobility ) , shimizu no obito and ochi no obito in sakyo-shoban , and hekita no obito in yamato province-shoban were his descendents .
** amenotokotachi no kami
** amenotokotachi no kami is a god ( shinto ) appearing in the japanese mythology .
** at the creation of heaven and earth ( the japanese mythology ) , amenotokotachi no kami was the last one to come into being as the five kotoamatsu kami ( separate heavenly deities ) .
he was regarded as hitorigami ( god without gender ) , and hid himself away just after coming into being .
he does not appear in the main text of nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , but appears in only kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) and arufumi ( supplement volumes of explanatory notes in nihonshoki ) of nihonshoki .
nihonshoki describes him as 天常立尊 ( amenotokotachi no mikoto ) .
** heaven or takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) itself is deified as this deity symbolizes heaven ' s eternity .
in sendai kujihongi ( ancient japanese history ) , he is identical to amenominakanushi no kami .
** as kunitokotachi no kami , who came into being after him , has been worshiped longer than he , he is probably created to form a pair with kunitokotachi no kami .
few shrines are dedicated to him because he is a metaphysical deity , and no description about his achievements can be found in mythology .
he is enshrined in the izumo taisha shrine ( izumo city ) as a guest deity ; he is also enshrined in the komagata-jinja shrine ( oshu city , iwate prefecture ) , kanemochi-jinja shrine ( hino-cho , hino-gun , tottori prefecture ) , etc .
** tajimamori
** tajimamori is a person appearing in japanese mythology , and is the god ( shinto ) of confection .
it is written 多遅麻毛理 in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) , and 田道間守 in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** he is the great-grandchild of amenohiboko , who came from silla .
he traveled to tokoyo no kuni ( some say this was silla , the land of his ancestors ) under the order of the 00th emperor suinin , to search for tokijikuno kagunokonomi ( crackerberry ) .
after ten years , he returned to japan with a branch with leaves and a branch with fruit , but emperor suinin had already passed away .
tajimamori presented half of them to the empress of emperor suinin , and the remaining to the misasagi ( imperial mausoleum ) of emperor suinin , and died , crying in sorrow .
** the ' tokijikuno kagunokonomi ' brought back by tajimamori is described as today ' s tachibana ( wild orange ) in kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) .
some say the name ' tachibana ' itself derived from tajimabana .
at that time , ' ka ' referred to fruit , but based on this setsuwa ( anecdotes ) , tajimamori is worshipped as ' kaso , ' the god of confection .
** stories about traveling to alien worlds in search of fruits and medicinal plants exist in various parts of the world , and this setsuwa is believed to be influenced by shinsenden ( lives of spirit immortals ) of china .
for example , there is a story about jofuku of qin traveling to horai in search of an elixir of life .
** tajimamori is enshrined in nakashima-jinja shrine ( toyooka city , hyogo prefecture ) as the god of confection .
the branch deities of nakashima-jinja shrine are enshrined nationwide in dazaifu tenman-gu shrine ( dazaifu city , fukuoka prefecture ) , yoshida-jinja shrine ( kyoto city ) , etc . , and is worshipped by confectioners .
** imari city , saga prefecture , is believed to be the land where tajimamori landed when returning from tokoyo no kuni , and at imari-jinja shrine , there is the nakashima-jinja shrine enshrining tajimamori .
the previous enshrined place of kitsumoto-jinja shrine in kainan city , wakayama prefecture , called ' roppongi no oka , ' is told to be the location where the tachibana tree brought back by tajimamori was first transplanted .
** jingiin ( institute of divinities )
** the jingiin was an organ of the national government of japan .
it was an external bureau of the home ministry .
it no longer exists .
** under jingikan ( agency of the department of divinities ) shinto refomation campaign , the insitute of divinities was founded in 0000 as part of the ceremonies commemorating the 0000th year of the founding of japan .
having produced no particularly noteworthy results , with the promulgation of the shinto directive after the war , on february 0 , 0000 , it was abolished .
** jingikan shinto refomation campaign
establishment of the jingiin
on november 0 , 0000 , the jingiin was founded as a replacement for the bureau of shinto shrines of the home ministry .
eiji yasui served as the first director , while concurrently holding the post of home minister .
** the shinto directive and the abolishment of the jingiin
the jingiin was abolished on february 0 , 0000 , and jurisdiction for matters relating to shrines was taken over by the jinja honcho ( association of shinto shrines ) on the following day .
** engishiki jinmyocho ( register of shrines in japan )
** the ' jinmyocho ' was originally a kansha list created by the jingikan ( department of worship ) , which was instituted under the kodai ritsuryosei ( ancient east asian system of centralized governance ) , and it is also called the kanshacho ( book of official shrines ) .
the shrines are sorted according to their provinces and districts , along with their respective enshrined deities and shrine rankings .
the engishiki jinmyocho is the series of the jinmyocho as of the time that the engishiki was documented .
the engishiki jinmyocho lists 0000 shrines ( thus called shikinaisha ) across the country , and the number of their enshrined deities ( shinto ) is 0000 .
** the shikinaisha shrines were regarded as official shrines by the imperial court at the beginning of the 00th century when the engishiki was edited , and its selection was greatly affected by the political situation .
shrines which definitely existed at that time but were not listed on the engishiki jinmyocho are called shikigesha .
the shikigesha shrines which are listed on the rikkokushi ( japan ' s six national histories ) are specially referred to as kokushigenzaisha ( some shikinaisha shrines are also included in this in a broad sense ) .
** the rankings of the shikinaisha shrines
there are several classifications of the shikinaisha shrines .
firstly , they are classified into kanpeisha ( shrines designated as official by jingikan ) and kokuheisha ( shrines under the control of provincial governors ) .
in 000 , the kansha shrines were divided into kanpeisha which continued to receive heihaku from jingikan , and kokuheisha which received heihaku from a kokushi ( provincial governor ) of the ryoseikoku ( province ) in where that shrine was .
shikinaisha consists of 000 kanpeisha shrines with 000 enshrined deities and 0000 kokuheisha shrines with 0000 enshrined deities .
although it is believed that kokuheisha was set up because hafuribe at shrines in distant provinces had difficulty in traveling to the capital city , some significant shrines in distant provinces were classified as kanpeisha .
** secondly , the shikinaisha shrines are classified into taisha ( grand shrines ) and shosha ( minor shrines ) .
it is believed that the shrines were classified according to their significance and influence .
since every shikinaisha shrine has to be classified into kanpeisha or kokuheisha , and taisha or shosha , each shikinaisha shrine must belong to one of the following four groups .
** kanpei-taisha ( grand shrines under the control of the department of worship )
000 shrines with 000 enshrined deities
kokuhei-taisha ( grand shrines under the control of provincial governors )
000 shrines with 000 enshrined deities
kanpei-shosha ( minor shrines under the control of the department of worship )
000 shrines with 000 enshrined deities
kokuhei-shosha ( minor shrines under the control of provincial governors )
0000 shrines with 0000 enshrined deities
most kanpei-taisha shrines are in the vicinal territories of the capital , but some are in other regions as well .
all the kanpei-shosha shrines are in the vicinal territories of the capital , and all the kokuhei-taisha and kokuhei-shosha shrines are out of the vicinal territories of the capital .
although the modern shrine ranking system has some rankings named the same , such rankings refer to different types of classification from the shikinaisha rankings .
also , the shrine rankings in the modern system have nothing to do with the shrine rankings in the engishiki , as they are determined according to the importance and influence of the shrines at the time of ranking .
** shikinaisha includes some shrines that receive heihaku at some services other than the kinen-sai festival , and such shrines have a note about this along with their shrine rankings .
** myojin
there are some shrines that enshrine ' myojin ' , the wonder-working deities , and have an extraordinary festival called the myojin-sai festival .
these shrines are called myojin-taisha ( or myojindai ) because they are all classified into taisha .
** tsukinami
the shrines that receive heihaku at the tsukinami-sai festival ( the festival held half-yearly , in june and december )
ainame
the shrines that have the ainame-sai festival ( a prayer to offer new crops to the deities before the niiname-sai festival )
niiname
the shrines that receive heihaku at the niiname-sai festival ( the festival held in november of each year to celebrate a harvest in that year )
** ronja ( shrines considered to be descendants of shikinaisha )
there has been a study to specify the descendents of the shikinaisha shrines for a long time .
in that case , such shrines are referred to as ronja .
the ronja shrines include many shrines that they themselves insist are shikinaisha as well as some shrines which are acknowledged to be a descendant shrine by external researchers .
** in recent years , they have had a nationwide survey of the extant shikinaisha shrines , and its result has been published in " shikinaisha chosa hokoku . " ( the report of the shikinaisha survey ) ( edited by shikinaisha kenkyukai , the kogakkan university publishing department )
** hime no kami
** hime no kami is a shinto god ( shinto ) .
** when describing the enshrined deity of a shrine , it is written 比売神 ( hime no kami ) ( 比売大神 ( hime okami ) ) , 比咩神 ( hime no kami ) , etc . , along with the shusaijin ( main enshrined deities )
this is not the name of a specific god , but refers to the wife or daughter of the shusaijin of the shrine or a goddess with strong ties .
** the most famous hime no kami is the hime okami of hachimanshin ( god of war ) .
at usa-jingu shrine and other shrines , it is considered that this refers to the munakata three gods , but there are many theories on the true identity of hime okami at hachiman-sha shrine .
** hime no kami enshrined at kasuga-taisha shrine is the wife of amenokoyane ( amenokoyane no mikoto ) , amenomitsutamateruhime no mikoto .
some shrines enshrine ohirumemuchi no mikoto ( amaterasu ) as hime no kami .
** hime-jinja shrine
it exists nationwide in japan , with hime no kami as the shusaijin .
those simply called ' hime-jinja shrine ' are often the setsumatsu sha ( smaller shrine managed under the shrine ) of other shrines .
** major shrines

** in kiki shinwa ( the mythology described in kojiki and nihonshoki ) , shiotsuchinooji plays an important role of providing information to the characters and suggesting the way they should take .
such a story in which a sea-related deity provides a suggestion is similar to the story of ' the old man of the sea ' which appears in greek mythology etc .
** furthermore , shiotsuchinooji is also worshipped as the deity of salt manufacture .
according to the shrine history of shiogama-jinja shrine ( shiogama city , miyagi prefecture ) , the head shrine of shrines that enshrine shiotsuchinooji , takemikazuchi and futsunushi came to shiogama after they had conquered various provinces with the guidance of shiotsuchinooji .

** shrine merger
** shrine merger is a policy to consolidate shrines .
it is also called shrine consolidation .
deities from several shrines were enshrined together in one shrine or transferred to the precinct of one shrine , and the rest of the shrines were abolished to reduce the total number of shrines .
it mainly refers to the policy enforced in the end of the meiji period .
** shrine merger enforced before modern times
** shrine merger of the okayama domain
shrine merger of the mito domain
shrine merger of the tsuwano domain
shrine merger in 0000
** shrine merger in the end of the meiji period
purpose
one purpose of the shrine merger was to reduce the total number of shrines and concentrate expenses to furnish the remaining shrines with facilities and properties that exceeded a certain standard .
it supposed to maintain the dignity of shrines and establish sustainable management .
another purpose was derived from the national principle that shrines were ' the nation ' s house of worship . '
in order to make local public entities spend public funds on shrines at lower shrine ranking , the total number of shrines had to be reduced to the amount that these entities ' finance could afford .
** this policy was led by bureau of shinto shrines , ministry of interior , but it is said that the bureau of regional affairs in the same ministry was also involved .
the bureau of regional affairs was negative about offering public funds from local public entities to prefectural and lower shrines , which was one of the purposes of a shrine merger , because it would be a further financial burden on these entities .
in exchange for agreeing with this measure , however , the bureau included the core shrine theory in the shrine merger policy as part of local governance policy .
** the core shrine theory is a concept that shrines should be at the core of local governance .
with this theory , a criterion of one shrine per one town or village was applied to the shrine merger policy .
by matching an area of shrine parishioners with an administrative district , it was intended to let the sole shrine in the town or village play a core role in regional activities .
** details of shrine merger
the imperial edict in 0000 advocated the shrine merger policy , and 00 , 000 out of approximately 000 , 000 shrines throughout the country were abolished by 0000 .
the policy affected mie prefecture most severely ; about 00% of the shrines in the prefecture were abolished .
the policy was intensively enforced in wakayama and ehime prefectures as well .
however , the enforcement of this policy was left to the discretion of the governor , so the extent of the enforcement varied from prefecture to prefecture .
for instance , only about one out of ten shrines were abolished in kyoto prefecture .
** this shrine merger policy based on bureaucratic pragmatism did not necessarily reflect the will of shrine parishioners and worshippers .
it was inevitable that a living community and an administrative district did not always match .
by the merger , some ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion ) were transferred far away from the residential area of shrine parishioners who couldn ' t visit the shrine anymore .
some shrines refused to be merged , but the merger was forced in some cases .
** movement against merger
some shrine parishioners and worshippers held campaigns against the merger , but these did not result in a large-scale movement .
all they could do was show their dissatisfaction by telling that ujigami of abolished shrines would curse those who carried out such acts .
** nonetheless , the shrine merger policy was gradually brought to an end by fierce opposition from intellectuals including kumagusu minakata , a natural historian and ethnologist known for his studies in slime mould .
due to the government ' s answers in the imperial diet , there seemed to be no intensive mergers after 0000 .
it was too late , however ; too much damage had already been done by this merger policy .
many rites , festivals , and customs were lost , and people ' s religious faith were destroyed .
** restoration of merged shrines
not a few of shrines that once had been merged were restored .
restoration was easier for the shrines that were nominally merged but their main building and other facilities remained .
generally , a shrine whose base of worship survived intact after the merger could be restored easily .
on the other hand , a shrine tended not to be restored if its base of worship was a community that disappeared or changed due to reorganization of administrative districts or change of situation .
** suseri-bime
** suseri-bime is a deity ( shinto religion ) who appears in the japanese mythology .
she is a daughter of susano and a legal wife of okuninushi .
her name is written as 須勢理毘売命 ( suserihime no mikoto ) or 須世理毘売命 ( suseribime no mikoto ) in " kojiki " ( record of ancient matters ) and as 須世理姫 ( suseri-bime ) in " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
wakasuserihime no mikoto , who appears in " izumo no kuni fudoki " ( fudoki of izumo province ) as a daughter of susano no mikoto and a wife of onamochi no mikoto , is conceived as the same deity .
** descriptions in mythology
descriptions in the kojiki are as follows :
please refer to the mythology of okuninushi for details .
** when suseribime no mikoto introduced onamuji no mikoto to her father after returning home , her father got him to sleep in the room inhabited by snakes or the room in which there were beans and centipedes .
suseribime no mikoto saved onamuji no mikoto by giving him ' hire ( sash ) , ' a magic tool .
susano no mikoto then slept at ease .
meanwhile , onamuji no mikoto bound susano no mikoto ' s hair to the pillar of the room and ran away with the iku-tachi sword , iku-yumiya bow and amenonorigoto harp in his hands , with suseribime no mikoto on his back .
as susano no mikoto couldn ' t catch up to them , he gave onamuji no mikoto the name okuninushi no mikoto and told him that he could make suseribime no mikoto his legal wife .
** although okuninushi had married yakami-hime earlier and had a child , yakami-hime returned to her parents ' home leaving kinomata no kami behind in awe of the legal wife , suseribime no mikoto .
** yachihoko no kami , in her confusion , tried to run away , but yamato no kuni presented a waka ( japanese poem ) urging him not to go , and eventually the two deities harmoniously settled at izumo-taisha shrine .
** " izumo no kuni fudoki " only describes the scene of onamuji no mikoto ' s tsumadoi visit to wakasuserihime no mikoto , who was in namesano-sato , kando-gun .
** explanation
some have asserted that such furious jealousy proves the greatness of this goddess .
** the story in nenokuni is a form of mythology called kadaikon ( subject marriage ) , in which a person is subjected to hardship by a marriage partner ' s father but eventually overcomes it with the advice or help of a marriage partner .
it is believed that onamuji successfully became the real okuninushi only after he overcame this hardship with her help and made suseri-bime his legal wife .
** norinaga motoori asserts that ' hayasasura-hime residing in nenokuni sokonokuni , ' who appears in oharae no kotoba , is the same deity as suseri-bime .
** shrines at which suseri-bime is enshrined
in most cases , she is enshrined along with okuninushi .
** saho-hime
** saho-hime is the god of spring .
** she is a young woman in a dress like the soft white spring haze .
it is a seasonal word for spring , and is used as a name for japanese confectionery .
** she is a god of mt . tatsuta , and is paired with tatsuta-hime of fall .
** she is unrelated to sao-hime ( sao-bime ) described in kiki ( the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) and the nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) ) .
refer to the page of sahohime no mikoto .
** tatsuta-hime
** tatsuta-hime ( 竜田姫 ) is the god of autumn in japan .
it is some time written 立田姫 .
** she is also worshipped as the god of sewing , since tatsu ( 竜 ) sounds similar to tatsu ( 裁つ ( cut ) ) .
additionally , due to the beauty of the colored autumnal leaves on mt . tatsuta , it was believed that this goddess who colored the autumnal leaves red was skilled in dyeing .
** kayano-hime
** kayano-hime ( or kayanu-hime ) is a god ( shinto ) of grass appearing in japanese mythology .
** she was born between izanagi and izanami during kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) .
in " kojiki , " she gave birth to four pairs of eight gods together with the mountain god , oyamatsumi .
the word ' kaya ' in the shinmei ( name of god ) represents kaya ( grass ) .
kaya was a familiar grass for humans , used to thatch roofs , and therefore , became the name of the god of grass , representing grass .
** at tarumaezan-jinja shrine ( tomakomai city , hokkaido ) , she is enshrined together with mountain god , oyamatsumi no kami , and god of trees , kukunochi .
at kayazu-jinja shrine ( jimokuji-cho , ama-gun , aichi prefecture ) , she is enshrined as the only goddess of pickles in japan , and is worshipped as the god of tabacco in areas producing tabacco leaves .
** the other name , ' nozuchi , ' means ' spirits in the field . '
however , this ' nozuchi ' later became the other name for japanese copperhead , and furthermore , was considered a monster snake .
nozuchi , due to its name , was believed to be shaped like a gripless hammer with a head and bottom similar in size , and would bite on people ' s feet .
tsuchinoko also derived from the monster snake , nozuchi .
** hoki-naiden
** the hoki-naiden is a treatise on divination that was handed down to subsequent generations as a text compiled by abe no seimei .
in fact , it was created after the death of seimei ( there are various theories as to when it came into existence ) .
** its formal name is ' sangokusoden onmyokankatsu hokinaiden kinu-gyokuto shu ' but this is sometimes abbreviated to ' kinu-gyokuto shu ' .
** summary
a kinu , a sacred bird that symbolizes the sun , is a golden bird with three legs that is said to be an inhabitant or an incarnation of the sun .
a gyokuto , a rabbit that symbolizes the moon , is said to be an inhabitant of the moon .
** in later years , a more readable version called ' hokisho ' was published .
for reference , ' hoki ' means saiki ( ritual utensil ) in ancient china .
according to the tradition , it is said that this book was written by monju bosatsu ( manjusri ) in tenjiku ( india ) , and was later handed down to hakudo shonin , who was seimei ' s legendary master , before it was passed down to seimei .
** in the beginning of the book , there appears an anecdote which shows how important the book was .
** priest doma ( doman ashiya ) living in harima province was defeated by seimei in a magic competition in front of the emperor and became his pupil thereafter .
however , he was watching for a chance to bring down seimei .
one day , he knew that a secret book ( kinu-gyokuto shu ) was in the possession of seimei .
so , doma had an adulterous relationship with seimei ' s wife , 梨子 , and tried to pump her for information on the whereabouts of the book .
seizing the opportunity when the relationship with seimei ' s wife became closer , doma extracted the information from her that the secret book was in a stone box .
however , she said even she did not know how to open the box .
** he had her show him the box while seimei was away and somehow managed to open it .
then , when seimei returned home , doma said to him , ' the secret book of divination now belongs to me . '
seimei reproached doma , saying , ' the book is the hard-earned result of my practice of asceticism in tang .
there ' s no way you own it . '
doma thought , ' this is the best opportunity to kill seimei . ' and said to him , ' then , if i really have the secret book , i ' ll cut your head off . ' and seimei carelessly agreed .
then , doma showed him kinu-gyokuto shu , which he had transcribed beforehand , and decapitated seimei .
** around the same time , hakudo shonin , who had passed down kinu-gyokuto shu to seimei , came to japan being aware that seimei had been killed .
around the same time , hakudo shonin , who had passed down kinu-gyokuto shu to seimei , came to japan being aware that seimei had been killed .
after that , in order to avenge the murder of his disciple , together with resurgent seimei , he headed for doma and 梨子 , who had not only betrayed seimei but also become doma ' s wife .
** is seimei here ? ' , hakudo asked doma .
doma replied , ' he once lived here but was killed by cutting off his head . '
then , hakudo said , ' that cannot be true .
i just met him . '
doma replied , ' it ' s what you say that cannot be true .
if seimei were still alive , you could cut off my head . '
so , hakudo called seimei , who had just risen from the dead , to appear before doma .
thus , doma was decapitated according to his promise and 梨子 was also killed .
** in this way , suggesting that anyone who reads this book recklessly or superficially deserves to die , this anecdote represents that this book should be given the highest secrecy .
in addition , placing this story at the beginning of the book makes the book seem even more mysterious and holy .
** the book consists of five volumes .
** the first volume describes engi ( writing about the history ) of gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) and various hoi-jin ( deities of bearings ) and their fortunes .
** the second volume explains engi of the world ' s first deity , bango-o , and its children , and also describes fortunes on calendar .
** the third volume explains nacchin and kubo ( both are the techniques of divination ) , etc . , which are not described in the first and the second volumes .
** the fourth volume expounds on the theory of fortune regarding feng shui and architecture .
** the fifth volume expounds on lunar mansion fortune-telling , which is a part of esoteric astrology .
** the fourth and fifth volumes obviously have different natures compared to those of the first through the third volumes .
the first and second volumes were written first , and after which the third volume was added as an enlarged edition of the previous volumes .
it is thought that the fourth and fifth volumes , which are considered to be independently-created , were incorporated into those volumes .
** ujigami ( tutelary deities in shinto )
** ujigami is a shinto god ( shinto ) jointly enshrined by the people living in a community ( village ) in japan .
the people who live around and believe in an ujigami call one another ujiko ( shrine parishners ) .
in modern days , the term , " ujigami " is often treated as a synonym for the deities chinjugami and ubusunagami .
** this page describes ujigami , chinju , ubusunagami , and ujiko .
** ujigami
as ujigami is written as a god of ' uji ' ( clan ) , it originally meant the ancestral or tutelary god enshrined by a ruling family in the area who formed a clan , ancient clanship .
** subsequently , after the heian period , the term , ' ujiko ' came to include not only the consanguineous members of a clan but also the people who lived with them .
this relates back to the fact that in early medieval times an udi ( clan ) organization , which assumed the form of ancient clanship , was formed by commoners in the local community in japan .
** after medieval times , ' ujiko ' referred to the entire people who lived in the areas surrounding a ujigami and participated in its festivals .
ujigami thus became indistinguishable from chinju and ubusunagami .
the people who enshrine a tutelary god are called ' ujikoju ' or ' ujikodo , ' whose representative called ujikosodai plays a central role in assisting the rituals and festivals at the shrine .
the one who worships a tutelary god without living around its shrine is called ' sukeisha ' ( worshipper ) , who together with ujiko , are collectively called ' ujiko-sukeisha ' ( parishners and worshippers ) .
** a well-known example of a clan ' s tutelary god are the fujiwara clan ' s kasuga deities ( kasuga shrine ) which includes its ancestral god amenokoyane .
this is classified as the older form of tutelary god worship based on ancestral gods .
the same can be said of umenomiya-taisha shrine worshipped by the tachibana clan .
among post-medieval examples , in which ujigami became synonymous with chinju and ubusunagami , are the god of hachiman ( hachiman-gu shrine ) worshipped by the minamoto clan and the three goddesses of munakata ( itsukushima-jinja shrine ) by the taira clan .
the ise-jingu shrine which enshrines the imperial ancestral god , thus regarded as a special shrine was the sole tutelary god of the imperial family before the edo period .
today , however , it is recognized as the universal tutelary god of the entire nation .
** chinju ( tutelary deity of land )
chinju is a god who has settled in a land to protect it and its people .
after the heian period , manorialism was formed .
private domains of nobility , warriors and temples were established .
this led to the collapse of clan society as well as the erosion of ujigami worship .
the feudal lords instead enshrined the guardian gods of the lands to protect their manors from wars and disasters .
these guardian gods were called the gods of chinju .
by the muromachi period , however , they became marginalized as the manorial system declined .
their shrines eventually merged with those of ujigami , which mostly continues to this day .
** ubusunagami ( tutelary deity of one ' s birthplace )
as the tutelary god of one ' s birthplace , ubusunagami was believed to protect him all through his life .
it was the same for chinju of most japanese who used to live in the same place from the cradle to the grave .
this process made ujigami identifiable as chinju .
such ujigami worship is still observed in shichigosan ( a celebration for three- , five- , and seven-year-old children ) .
omiyamairi ( ( the custom of ) taking one ' s baby to a shrine ) was originally one of the initiation rituals in which a baby was taken to the tutelary to ask the permission to become a member of the local community .
** ujiko ( shrine parishner )
the relation between ujigami and ujiko generally comes into effect when a child becomes an ujiko of the tutelary of his family or of the shrine in the neighborhood .
as omiyamairi is made to ubusunagami the guardian god of a child ' s birthplace , ubusunagami is often treated as ujigami or the tutelary .
omiyamairi is not necessarily the same as the initiation ritual of ujiko .
as mentioned above , however , in practice it often means the latter since the distinction between ujigami and ubusunagami was lost .
this is why a baby is usually given ujikofuda ( an ujiko amulet ) at omiyamairi .
unless one is born into a family that has worshipped the tutelary deity and participated in rituals and festivals at the shrine over many generations , he takes his baby to the tutelary god and simply follows convention .
in fact , many people do so without knowledge or awareness of being shrine parishners .
** similarly , a bridegroom or bride who marries into the spouse ' s family often performs the initiation ritual of ujiko by visiting the tutelary god of the family .
nowadays , participation in shrine ceremonies and festivals and devotion to the tutelary , parishners ' duties , have become perfunctory , perhaps because the populace who support and participate in shinto rituals and festivals have aged and declined .
many families merely install kamidana ( a household shinto altar ) , in which sacred jewels and ujiko amulets are placed , and to which offerings are given .
** amatsumikaboshi
** amatsumikaboshi is a god of stars ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
other names are amenokagaseo and kagaseo .
** it does not appear in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) , but appears only in the conquest of ashihara no nakatsukuni in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** atsutane hirata claims the ' mika ' in the shinmei ( name of god ) means ' fierce , ' and that amatsumikaboshi represents venus .
the word ' kaga ' means ' shine ' and is believed to describe the stars shining .
** gods deifying stars and the moon are seen all over the world , and gods of stars in particular are sometimes treated as shusaijin ( main enshrined deities ) .
however , in japanese mythology , the god of stars is depicted as a god who should be brought to submission , or ' matsurowanu kami ' ( disobedient god ) .
regarding this , some say it refers to the fact that there was a tribe which worshipped the god of stars , and who did not obey the yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) .
** many of the hoshi-jinja shrines and hoshinomiya-jinja shrines nationwide enshrine amatsumikaboshi .
** omika-jinja shrine in hitachi city , ibaraki prefecture enshrines takehazuchi no mikoto , who brought amatsumikaboshi to submission .
according to the shrine ' s biography , mikaboshikakaseo ( amatsumikaboshi ) took up residence in mt . omika of hitachi province and reigned togoku ( the eastern part of japan ) .
the shukkonseki stone which constitutes the holly precincts of omika-jinja shrine is believed to be the stone where the aramitama ( god ' s rough soul ) of mikaboshikakaseo was contained .
according to one theory , since the curse of amatsumikaboshi continued after being contained by takehazuchi no mikoto , omika-jinja shrine enshrining takehazuchi no mikoto was built to quiet this down .
** for being the last god to resist the conquest of ashihara no nakatsukuni in nihonshoki , it is at times viewed as the same god as takeminakata .
additionally , it is sometimes viewed as an incarnation of myoken bosatsu who deified the polar star .
** toyotama-hime
** toyotamahime no kami ( toyotama-hime ) is a god ( shinto ) appearing in volume one of " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , and the mythology of yamasachihiko and umisachihiko .
she is the daughter of sea god , watatsumi ( watazumi ) .
** in kojiki , it is written 豊玉毘売 and 豊玉毘売命 ( toyotama-bime ) , and in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) and sendai kujihongi ( ancient japanese history ) , 豊玉姫 and 豊玉姫命 ( toyotamahime no mikoto ) .
** she married hoori ( = yamasachihiko ) , who was born between tenson ( the grandson of the sun goddess ) ninigi and konohana no sakuya-bime , the daughter of oyamatsumi , and gave birth to ugayafukiaezu .
ugayafukiaezu no mikoto was brought up by her sister , tamayori-hime , and later gave birth to kamuyamatoiwarebiko no mikoto ( = emperor jinmu ) with tamayori-bime .
** there is no detailed description on kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) , but due to the name toyotama , some say she was a princess from izumo , a major production area for magadama , a comma-shaped bead .
** watatsumi
** watatsumi ( or wadatsumi ) is a sea god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
it is written 綿津見 , 海神 ( wata no kami ) , etc .
** the word ' wata ' is an ancient word for sea , ' tsu ' means ' of , ' and ' mi ' means divine spirit , so ' watatsumi ' means ' divine spirit of the sea . '
it is also used as another name for the sea .
** the watatsumi god first to appear in japanese mythology was owatatsumi ( owatatsumi no kami ) .
it was born between the two gods , izanagi and izanami in the chapter of kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) .
in kiki , izanagi ordered susano to govern the sea .
** it is believed that it was originally one god , but was divided into the upper , middle , and lower three gods .
utsushihikanasaku , the child of watatsumi no kami , is described as the soshin ( ancestor honored as god ) of the azumi clan .
sokotsutsunoo no mikoto , nakatsutsunoo no mikoto , and uwatsutsunoo no mikoto , who are the sumiyoshi sanjin ( sumiyoshi three deities ) or sumiyoshi okami ( the great gods of sumiyoshi ) , were born at the same time .
** ugayafukiaezu , the child of the two gods , was brought up by tamayori-hime , the sister of toyotama-hime , and later married and gave birth to emperor jinmu and others .
the origin of watatsumi no okami is not described , but it is considered to be the same god as owatatsumi .
** age of calamity
** summary
** as propagated by onmyodo ( the traditions of yin-yang divination and astronomy ) , a person is believed to suffer misfortunes during their age of calamity .
** the tradition of calamitous ages , whose genesis is shrouded in obscurity , but which already existed in the heian period , still runs deep in japanese society .
** this is why people practice ' yakubarai ' ( exorcism of bad luck ) or ' yakuyoke ' ( avoidance of bad luck ) at their ages of calamity , in order to pre-empt adversity or misfortune by the help of shinto and buddhist deities .
even if nothing bad happens , physical deterioration may manifest itself as decreased strength or slower reflex at the ages of major calamity .
people of these ages may need to pay more attention to their health .
** in some places , the ages of shichigosan ( a celebration for three-year , five-year and seven-year old children ) are also included in the calamitous ages in their broadest sense .
in this case the earliest age of calamity is the age of three ( in japanese age reckoning ) for both men and women .
the notion of the age of calamity is not limited to countries where the traditions of yin and yang divination and astronomy , shinto or buddhism have been spread .
it is also found in christian countries like britain and spain and in islamic countries such as egypt and turkey .
** widespread and well-established in each region , it ranges from simple pilgrimage for the purpose of avoiding bad luck to a community-wide celebration .
** there is also a custom of counting calamitous ages by multiplication : the age of 00 expressed as ' a calamitous age of five times five . '

** misogi ( ablution )
** rite of passage
** relationship between ablutions and naked festivals
** modern ablutions
** modern meaning of misogi
** references
** the term , " misogi , " ( ablution ) has two meanings .
** it refers to the washing of oneself in icy water , the river , sea or waterfall in shinto or buddhism when one ' s body is polluted , or before or during an important shinto ceremony .
in buddhism , it is primarily called mizugori ( purification by cold water ) .
** it is a simplified form of misogiharae ( ablution and ritual purification ) .
it is used as a season word for summer in haiku ( seventeen-mora poetry ) and tanka ( thirty-one syllables ' poem ) .
** in some regions boys ( and occasionally girls ) who come of a certain age may not be recognized as grownups until they perform their ablutions as a passage rite .
** in principle , both men and women must be dressed in white , though men may also wear loincloths .
** if a loincloth is worn , it must as a rule be of white ecchu type but could also be a g-string .
** many of the naked festivals around the country are festive forms of ablution as a passage rite .
** in naked festivals of ablution type , participants often pour icy water over their heads or go into the river or sea in the middle of winter .
in some derived forms of these festivals , people splash one another with hot spring water , mud , amazake ( sweet mild sake ) or festive red rice .
** it is also common that participants carrying portable shrines are drenched in water or go into the river or sea . this is also seen as a kind of ablution .

this is also seen as a kind of ablution .
** one of the modern ablutions is a shrine visitor ' s purifying himself in a purification font as a religious practice before participating in a shinto ceremony .
** some people perform their ablutions by entering the river , sea or waterfall .
this form of ablution is performed by shrine people at a workshop , etc . it can also be organized by a shrine , inviting its parishners for spiritual training in the depth of winter .

** on such an occasion spiritual athletes may perform ablutions as a part of their mid-winter training .
some athletes pour cold water over their heads before their training .
** the first meaning of the word misogi has been extended to mean a certain ( cooling-off ) period during which a politician who has committed a crime withdraws from his candidacy .
or if the politician stands in election again after the cooling-off period , he recognizes this election as his ablutions and if he is elected , he can then say , " i have performed my ablutions . "
** this word can be used as in , ' mr . so-and-so is going to do his misogi ( ablutions ) . '
** a homonym of the japanese term for ablution refers to wood used to create shinto or buddhist statues .
hinoki cypress , sandalwood , chinaberry , japanese bigleaf magnolia , etc . are used .
** oharae is an ancient shinto purification ritual in which one-hundred court officials ( including imperial princes ) gathered in front of the suzaku-mon gate on the last day of the sixth and twelfth months of the year to cleanse people of their sins and purify them .
in modern time , too , it is preformed at the imperial court as well as shrines around the country .
it is also called nakatominoharae .
based on these shinto rituals , it has been used as a season word symbolizing summer and winter in haiku and tanka .
** shikinensai ( periodic religious rite )
** major periodic religious rites
** some prestigious shrines conduct major rites in prescribed years .
for example , both kashima-jingu shrine and katori-jingu shrine perform a large-scale rite of jinkosai in the year of the horse which occurs every twelve years .
suwa-taisha shrine famously celebrates a rite of onbashirasai at seven ( effectively six since a year in which the festival is held is counted as year one ) year intervals in the year of tiger or monkey .
these festivals are regarded to be of the utmost significance , held on a larger scale than annual festivals .
some shrines periodically rebuild shrines ( shikinen sengu or the transfer of the deity to a new shrine in prescribed years ) .
if the rebuilding of a shrine is seen as a part of the larger rite , it can be said to be a kind of shikinensai .
one of the most famous periodic rites of this kind is shikinen sengu at the ise-jingu shrine , which is a grand festival where all the shrines are rebuilt every twenty years .
less attention is paid to the fact that a rite of onbashirasai at suwa-taisha shrine also includes the rebuilding of shrines in its rituals .
therefore it can be considered to be shikinen sengu .
periodic rites are not limited to great shrines .
they are also held by even some tutelary shrines based on their origins and histories , together with the enshrined deities .
** many memorial ceremonies for the ancestral spirits are also held at specified intervals .
** the imperial family also performs a shinto shikinensai memorial ceremony to commemorate the imperial ancestral spirits at three , five , ten , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty year intervals , with a subsequent ceremony held every 000 years .
both nikko tosho-gu shrine and kitano tenman-gu shrine , dedicated to the historical figures , celebrate major festivals every 00 years .
this can be seen as the amalgamation of the shinto and buddhist periodic rites .

** omonoimi no kami
** omonoimi no kami is a god ( shinto ) believed to dwell in mt . chokai .
there are shrines enshrining omonoimi no kami in various locations in the tohoku region , including chokaisan-omonoimi-jinja shrine at the summit of mt . chokai .
** since mt . chokai is in the northern area of the region ruled by the ancient yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) , omonoimi no kami was considered a god guarding the nation , and also a god purifying stains .
since mt . chokai is a volcano and the eruption of mt . chokai was believed to be the anger of omonoimi no kami , a higher shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) was granted every time it erupted .
** omonoimi no kami is considered to be the same god as ukano mitama , toyouke-bime , oimi no kami , hirose-taisha shrine , etc .
it is described as the same god as toyouke no okami ( grand divine toyouke ) of the geku ( the outer shrine ) of jingu shrine , in the biography of chokaisan-omonoimi-jinja shrine .
uganomitama no mikoto is enshrined as the god of mt . chokai at the chokai gassan ryosho-gu shrine
** ukei ( ancient divination )
** ukei is the act of divination practiced in ancient japan .
it is written as 宇気比 ( phonetic representation of the word ) , 誓約 ( pledge ) , 祈 ( prayer ) , 誓 ( vow ) , etc .
for a question ( e . g . does susano have bad intentions ? ) , an act was performed , with the vow that the answer would be in the affirmative if it produced a certain result , but in the negative if it did not .
depending on the result of an act , people determined whether a proposition was fortunate or unfortunate , right or wrong , or successful or unsuccessful .
** such a pledge is often made in critical moments in japanese mythology .
** ascending from the earth to the celestial world of takamagahara , susano pledges to amaterasu that he has no bad intentions of conquering the heavens ( susano ' s pledge to amaterasu ) .
in this tale , the two gods exchange their own object with each other to determine whether or not susano has bad intentions on the basis of the gender of children who are born out of the objects .
in the episode on the restoration of the country of ashihara no nakatsukuni , takamimusubi sees the arrow he gave amenowakahiko flying out from the earth .
he resorts to pledge to determine whether or not the arrow was used to pacify the country .
he shoots the arrow back at the earth , with the vow that it will not hit amenowakahiko if it is meant for pacification , and hit him if it is not .
it hits amenowakahiko right in the chest , killing him .

however , he suspects her virginity .
thereupon she sets fire to a childbirth hut where she is going to give birth , pledging that the child will not be born if it is not by ninigi , but it will if by him .
she successfully gives birth to the child .
** shinsosai ( shinto funeral )
** history of shinsosai
** shinto ' s view of life and death
** characteristics of shinsosai
** shinsosai refers to funeral rites performed by shinto , japan ' s original religion .
** japan ' s ancient funeral style was described in japanese mythology , particularly in the episode of the funeral for amenowakahiko in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , in which details of ancient funerals are elaborated on .
** since the introduction of buddhism to japan , buddhist funerals spread rapidly as japan ' s funeral rites .
after the edo period , to prevent the spread of christian faith , buddhist funerals became obligatory through the introduction of the " terauke seido " ( the system of organizing whole temples in japan with registration of follower families=every person should belong to a buddhist temple ) .
as a result , the ( edo ) bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) gave approval for shinsosai to a limited extent .
** after the meiji period , the government encouraged shinsosai as part of " jingi policy " ( policy advocated by " jingisho , " or ministry of divinities ) .
for example , as a cemetery designated exclusively to shinsosai , the aoyama cemetery was set up .
on july 00 , 0000 , cremation was prohibited on the grounds that it was a buddhist practice ( cremation was allowed again on may 00 , 0000 ) .
some communities converted to shinsosai as a whole , following the ordinance distinguishing shinto and buddhism and " haibutsu-kishaku " ( a movement to abolish buddhism ) .
because freedom of religion was guaranteed , although still limited , by the meiji constitution , people were not forced to perform shinsosai .
as a result , the promulgation of shinsosai grew stagnant except at sect shinto ( new religion close to shinto ) , which was allowed to engage in religious activities .
after wwii , shinto recovered its status as a religious faith and has been allowed performing funeral rites .
** currently , buddhist funerals are still popular , but shinsosai has shown an upward trend on the grounds that the meanings of rites are easy to understand , and that compared with funerals of other religious faiths , shinsosai puts a lighter strain on finances .
** the objective of shinsosai , therefore , is to transform the deceased to a tutelary spirit of his/her household .
also , because shinto associates death with " kegare " ( impurity ) , funeral rites are rarely performed at a shrine , a sacred place where gods rest .
instead , funeral rites are performed at the deceased ' s house or a funeral hall .
it ' s important , however , to understand that according to shinto ' s definition , the term ' kegare ' ( impurity ) does not mean ' dirty or uncleanliness . '
the word ' kegare ' refers to a depressed state of mind , in which vigorous life force diminishes because of the pain of bereavement ( this state can be expressed as ' kegare ( a homonym ) , ' literary , the exhausted mind ) .
** a " shigo " ( a posthumous name ) is given .
the last part , which represents the age and sex of the deceased , is concluded with ink-written " reigo " ( spiritual title ) such as ' ushi ' for adult men and ' toji ' for adult women .
examples of shigo are " xxx ( the name of the deceased ) 美志真心高根 ushi " and " xxx sanae warame " ( for a girl who died young ) .
incense is not used .
in buddhist funerals , " shoko " ( incense offering ) is practiced during funeral rites , and incense is placed upright in front of a buddhist altar whereas in shinsosai , shoko and the use of incense are rarely practiced .
the practice in shinsosai that corresponds to shoko is ' tamagushihoten . '
the word ' tamagushi ' refers to a branch of sacred trees , such as sakaki , with " shide " ( a zigzag-shaped paper streamer ) being attached to the branch .
sometimes , ' kenmai ' or ' kenpai , ' in which rice ( the former ) or sake ( the latter ) is poured into a container , is practiced instead .
graves
shinto-style graves are called ' okutsuki ' ( spelled as ' 奥都城 , or alternatively ' 奥城 ' ) .
when visiting a grave , you are required to offer not incense but sakaki , rice , salt , water , sake , and so on .
of course , it is acceptable to offer foods that were loved by the deceased or flowers .
mitamaya ( where ancestral spirits were enshrined )
祖霊舎 ( pronounced as ' mitamaya ' and also spelled as ' 御霊舎 ' or ' 御霊屋 ' ) is shinto equivalent of a buddhist altar .
the majority of them are made of hinoki ( japanese cypress ) wood and , in general , it is simpler than a buddhist altar .
usually , mitamaya is placed under " kamidana " ( a household shinto altar ) .
manners for regular worship and offerings are same as when worshipping kamidana , but the worship of kamidana should precede the worship of mitamaya .
shinsosai procedures
makura-naoshi no gi ( pillow-adjustment rite )
this is the first rite of shinsosai .
the death of a loved one is reported to kamidana and mitamaya .
then , white japanese paper is attached to the front side of the kamidana ( this practice is called ' kamidana-fuji ' ( the household shrine is closed and covered with a white paper , to keep out the impure spirits of the dead ) .
kamidana-fuji will be discarded at the memorial service held on the 00th day after loved one ' s death . )
the body of the loved one is clothed in white " kosode " ( a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing by the upper classes ) and laid down so that his/her pillow faces north , and a sword for protection is placed next to the pillow .
an altar is set up in front , and rice , sake , salt , water , items loved by the deceased , and so on are offered .
nokan no gi ( coffin rite )
this is a rite for placing the body in a coffin .
the lid is put on the coffin , and after covering the coffin with white fabric , all the attendants pray .
in some cases , a rite of " matsugo-no-mizu " ( water of the last moment ) is performed , whereby the mouth of the deceased is wetted with leaves of sakaki soaked with water .
incidentally , rigor mortis sometimes has already set in , or even if it has not , there are cases these days in which the body has already become stiff because of dry ice , and so on .
in this case , it is common that the body is just covered with a garment , and eboshi is placed near the pillow .
if the deceased is bathed after death ( called ' yukan ' ) as a newborn baby take " ubuyu " ( a baby ' s first bath ) , there is no problems because the body becomes flexible .
tsuyasai ( a ritual wake ) and senreisai ( rite for transferring the deceased spirit )
" tsuyasai " ( a ritual wake ) corresponds to buddhist funeral ' s " tsuya " ( a wake , all-night vigil over a body ) .
" senreisai " is a rite for transferring the deceased spirit to reiji so that the spirit would rest at reiji .
a shinto priest chants a eulogy while the family of the deceased offers tamagushi and prays .
in senreisai , ' mitama utsushi no gi ' ( a rite for transferring spirit ) is performed , whereby a shinto priest transfers the spirit of the deceased from the body to reiji while the room is darkened so that it represents a night .
in this rite , the priest mumbles " keihitsu , " or sounds of heralding ( sometimes with a drum ) , and this sound is prototype of the onomatopoeia ( sound effect ) ' hyu-doro-doro-doro , ' which is used in japanese ghost films .
sojosai ( grave-side rites )
" sojosai " is a series of the most important and ceremonious rites of shinsosai to pay final respects ( bid final farewell ) to loved ones .
in sojosai , s set of rites such as the delivering of memorial addresses , the announcement of condolence telegrams , the chanting of a eulogy by a shinto priest , and the offering of tamagushi are performed .
sojosai corresponds to a buddhist funeral ceremony and a memorial service .
kasosai ( crematory rite )
" kasosai " is a rite performed at a crematorium before cremating the body .
a shinto priest chants a eulogy while the family of the deceased offers tamagushi and prays .
maisosai ( interment rite )
" maisosai " is a rite for burying cremains in a cemetary .
the gravesite is surrounded by " shimenawa " ( sacred rice-straw ropes ) stretched among bamboos set up at four corners of the gravesite , and cremains are buried while a priest chants a eulogy , and the family of the deceased prays .
in shinsosai , cremains are brought directly from a crematorium to the grave and buried .
recently , however , it has become more popular for the family of the deceased to bring cremains to their home and bury them at the memorial service held 00 days after a loved one ' s death , the time when mourning ends .
kikasai ( the rite of the family ' s return home ) and naorai ( feast )
when the family of the deceased goes home after cremation and burial , they are given " oharai " ( purification ) by a shinto priest , and the family throws salt to the gates ( door ) of their house .
and the family reports to the spirit of the deceased that the funeral rites were finished without problems .
then , " naorai " ( feast ) is convened .
naorai refers to a banquet presented by the family of the deceased to thank the shinto priest , stewards , and so on for their services in funeral rites .
with the end of naorai , all the funeral rites ( shinsosai ) are completed , and subsequent memorial services will be performed as " mitamamatsuri . "
mitamamatsuri
" mitamamatsuri " ( memorial services ) are held on the 00th , 00th , 00th , 00th , and 00th days after death , followed by the first anniversary .
mitamamatsuri held on the 00th and 00th day after death correspond to buddhist memorial service held on the 0th and 00th days after death , respectively .
mitamamatsuri held on the 00th , 00th , and 00th day after death are sometimes omitted , although this varies depending on regions and shinto priests in charge of funeral rites .
incidentally , the first anniversary is followed by third , fifth , and 00th anniversaries , and afterwards , mitamamatsuri is held every five years .
dos and don ' ts in shinsosai
buddhist funerals are performed by buddhist monks whereas shinsosai is performed by shinto priests .
of course , because shinsosai is shinto ceremonies , you are not supposed to bring " juzu " ( buddhist prayer beads ) .
the cover address of an envelope that contains condolence money for shinsosai should be ' otamagushiryo , ' ' osakakiryo , ' ' goshinzen , ' or ' goreizen . '
in the case of mitamamatsuri , the cover address should also be ' otamagushiryo , ' and so on .
the payment for services given by a shinto priest should be titled as ' osaishiryo , ' ' onrei , ' ' goshinsenryo , ' or ' osakakiryo . '
incidentally , a lotus flower motif should not be printed on envelopes .
this clapping style is called ' shinobite . '
after gigoreisai ( 儀後霊祭 ) , you can clap your hands in a normal manner .
rules , however , may differ depending on religious doctrines ( different sect shintos ) and local practices , such as the presence or absence of shinobite and the number of clapping , so you are required to follow specific rules .
** soreisha ( ancestral altar )
** soreisha ( or mitamaya ) are household altars that are used in shinto to enshrine ancestral spirits .
they are a type of interior shrine .
they are also called reisha , tamaya , tamadana , tamatoko and shintodan .
jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) calls such altars reisha .
soreisha were introduced as an alternative to buddhist alters in conducting shinto religious services for ancestors .
** they are placed below a kamidana ( a household shinto altar hung high on a wall in a cupboard or on shelf ) .
the direction of installation and the manner for making daily offers to the alter and worship are the same as for household shinto alters , but offers and worship should be done after household shinto altars .
it corresponds to a buddhist altar in buddhism .
while buddhist alters are originally for enshrining buddha statues , soreisha enshrine ancestral spirits for being guardian deities for the houses , and this is the major difference between them .
a sacred jewel is placed at the center for enshrinement .
** sorei
** sorei ( or mioyanomitama ) is an ancestral soul .
this term is used especially in the religious service of shinto .
in many cases , the word ' sorei ' refers to a soul or collective of souls whose bodies died quite long time ago and individualities in life were lost .
it is considered that this notion has been around since the jomon period .
during the mythical age of the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) and the nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , it is written of susano ' s grief of loving her mother as a soul .
** according to kunio yanagida , in japanese folk beliefs , the spirit whose body died within a certain number of years needing services is called ' shiryo ' , and is distinguished from sorei .
shiryo gradually loses its individuality by services .
** the shoshi ( small shrine ) built in graveyards or related places to enshrine ancestral souls is called reisha shrine , and the reisha shrine enshrining all the ancestors is called soreisha shrine .
the worship in soreisha shrine is only for descendants , and tend to exclude other people .
in old times , as a place to enshrine the sorei of imperial family , the ise-jingu shrine had a rule called shihei kindan ( nobody but the emperor could go and pray there ) , which was an example of such exclusiveness .
** there is also an idea that a sorei will become a deity ( shinto ) .
such sorei are enshrined as a soshin ( an ancestor honored as god ) or ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion ) in a clan or rural community .
in okinawa region it was believed that a soul would become a deity in seven generations .
** although this ancestor worship was general in uncivilized societies and ancient societies , it had declined because of world religion ( buddhism , christianity ) believing blood relationship only exists in the living world .
however there is an example of syncretization with ancestor worship which was indigenized in japanese buddhism .
** ikihagi ( skinning animals alive )
** it is agreed that ikihagi refers to the action of skinning horses alive .
** amenowakahiko
** amenowakahiko is a deity from japanese mythology .
** origin
in the legend of the pacification of ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the central land of reed plains ) , amenowakahiko is described as a child of amatsukunitama .
there is no description of the genealogy of amatsukunitama .
** achievements
amenohohi was the first kami god sent to pacify ashihara no nakatsukuni but three years later had still not returned and so amenowakahiko was sent .
amenowakahiko , however , took as his wife shitateruhime , the daughter of okuninushi , and made plans to rule over ashihara no nakatsukuni himself and , after eight years , still had not returned to takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
therefore , amaterasu ( the sun goddess ) and takamimusubi dispatched the pheasant nakime to inquire of amenowakahiko ' s true intentions .
the arrow pierced nakime and continued to climb to heaven where it was found by takamimusubi in the plain of high heaven .
vowing that the arrow would strike amenowakahiko if he had a wicked heart , takamimusubi flung it back down to earth where it struck amenowakahiko mortally in the breast while he was sleeping in his bedroom .
** when the wailing voice of shitateruhime mourning amenowakahiko ' s death was carried to heaven , amatsukunitama , amenowakahiko ' s father , descended to earth , built a mourning hut , and performed funeral rites .
when ajisukitakahikone , the brother of shitateruhime , came to pay his respects , his striking resemblance to amenowakahiko caused the father and wife of amenowakahiko to embrace him , saying , ' amenowakahiko is alive ' .
this act enraged ajisukitakahikone , who yelled ' how dare you mistake me for a filthy dead man ' and , drawing his sword , destroyed the mourning hut .
** explanation
the name ' wakahiko ' means ' young man ' .
one theory states that his name does not include the honorific title of ' kami , ' ' mikoto ' or ' takeru ' because ' wakahiko ' is a common noun and not a divine name .
another theory states that his name includes no honorific title because he rebelled against the amatsukami ( the gods of heaven ) .
** there is a theory that since amenowakahiko and ajisukitakahikone looked alike , they were originally the same deity .
in other words , this is a story of the death of amenowakahiko and his resurrection as ajisukitakahikone .
this story represents grain withering in the autumn and reviving in spring ; or the sun weakening in winter and reviving in the spring .
** traditions and beliefs
amenowakahiko was popular among ordinary people as a tragic and rebellious deity because of his falling love with shitateruhime and giving up on his mission and then being killed for the sin .
** as the deity of grain , abiko-jinja shrine ( hatasho town , echi county , shiga prefecture ) is one of the few shrines to enshrine amenowakahiko .
** naobi no kami
** naobi no kami ( or nahobi no kami ) are deities in shintoism .
they are considered to be deities of purification and the removal of calamities .
** in the japanese myths that deal with the birth of the gods , when izanagi returned from the underworld of yomi and underwent misogi ( ritual cleansing ) , the magatsuhi no kami were produced from the impurity .
to rectify the disorder produced by the magatsuhi no kami , the naobi no kami were born .
** " naho " means to correct something abnormal .
" bi " is said to be the " bi " in " kushibi , " a divine spirit ; " naobi " is also said to be the noun form of " naobu . "
in any case , naobi no kami are deities who change misfortune into fortune .
" naho " forms a counterpart to " maga . "
nobuo origuchi pointed out that the nahobi no kami were produced to counterbalance the magatsuhi no kami and , as such , they were two sides of the same coin .
moreover , the nahobi no kami can be considered as the priests who perform purification rituals , and izunome as a shrine maiden .
** futsunushi no kami
** futsunushi no kami is a deity that appears in japanese mythology .
he appears in the " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , but not in the " kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) .
he is also called iwainushi no kami .
in " izumo no kuni fudoki " ( culture and geography of izumo province ) , futsunushi no kami ( 経津主神 ) is written 布都怒志命 .
** according to an addendum to the seventh chapter , the blood of kagutsuchi splashed onto the rocks by the ame no yasu-kawa river , transforming them into iwasaku no kami and nesaku no kami .
their children , iwatsutsunoo and iwatsutsunome , produced futsunushi no kami .
during the pacification of ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the central land of reed plains ) , futsunushi no kami descended from heaven to izumo accompanied by takemikazuchi and urged okuninushi to transfer the land to the descendants of the heavenly deities .
however , accounts found in " izumo no kuni fudoki " and " izumo kokuso kamuyogoto " ( divine words of the ritual priest of izumo taisha shrine ) portray futsunushi no kami as descending alone .
in tatenui no sato , ou county , izumo province ( presently yasugi city , shimane prefecture ) , an anecdote is told about futsunushi no kami sewing together the rock ama no iwatate , which had been split in two .
** since ' futsu ' is an onomatopoeic term referring to the sound of a sword severing something , futsunushi no kami became the god of the power of swords .
in " sendai kujihongi " ( ancient japanese history ) , on the other hand , futsu no mitama is called " futsunushi no kami ' s sword of spirits . "
** the " kojiki " records that takemikazuchi no kami is also called takefutsu no kami or toyofutsu no kami .
in the " kojiki " , takemikazuchi no kami plays the main role in pacifying ashihara no nakatsukuni , suggesting that takemikazuchi and futsunushi are the same deity .
due to the fact that isonokami-jingu shrine , which enshrines futsu no mitama , is considered to have been the armory of the mononobe clan , it is believed that futsunushi no kami was originally the mononobe clan ' s guardian deity .
with the rise of the nakatomi clan , however , futsunushi ' s divine attributes were gradually appropriated by takemikazuchi , the nakatomi clan ' s guardian deity .
** futsunushi no kami is the main deity at katori-jingu shrine and on the other side of the tone-gawa river , kashima-jingu shrine enshrines takemikazuchi no kami .
futsunushi is also enshrined , along with takemikazuchi and other deities , at kasuga taisha shrine .
the joso region where both katori-jingu and kashima-jingu shrines stand was the stronghold of the nakatomi ( fujiwara ) clan , so the spirits of both deities were divided and transferred to kasuga taisha shrine , the fujiwara family shrine .
in addition , shiogama-jinja shrine enshrines futsunushi and takemikazuchi together with shiotsuchinooji .
** shintai
** summary
** temporary , simplified shintais
** the ancient shinto
** the imperial shinto
** the shrine shinto
** a shintai or goshintai ( ' go ' is an honorific prefix ) means the body of a kami ( deity ) in the shinto religion .
** basically all the sects of shinto have originated from the ancient shinto , and include the folk beliefs that other religions syncretized , the shrine shinto , and the imperial household shinto .
each of them has its own characteristic shintai , and each characteristic deity is worshiped .
the kami in the ancient shinto include yori-gami god ( the god that comes from another distant world beyond the sea ) and tsukumo-gami god ( the divine spirit that lives in an extremely old tool or creature ) .
shrine shinto and imperial household shinto mainly humanized divinities ( such divinities are sometimes referred to as " mikoto " ) .
as a result , the ancient shinto is more comprehensive and subsumptive than the shrine shinto and the imperial household shinto .
the divinities are called in many ways such as kami ( god ) , mikoto using the letters 尊 or 命 , tama ( soul ) , shoryo or mitama ( both mean the departed soul ) , and have different meanings .
historically all these divinities have been subsumed and accepted without being defined in the shinto religion , and thus everything in the universe can be a shintai , a mitamashiro , or a yorishiro .
** a shintai is sometimes called kamiyo or kamishiro using the same letters 神代 .
in this sense , a kamishiro is not a substitute container , but can be considered as the world of shinto itself or the deity itself .
** some of the shintais are inherited for many generations ; other shintais are renewed regularly .
that is , the shintais can be divided into two categories : the first group of shintais is used for a regular period and then replaced by a new one , and the second group of shintais does not have a fixed period for use and replacement .
how and when a shintai is renewed or taken over do not depend on its complexity or size .
** in other cases , the place where a kami stays ( a shintai ) was thought to be the boundary between this world and the eternal world and thus the entrance to the kingdom of gods .
furthermore , natural phenomena such as the sun ( sometimes called ohisama as its honorific ) , the fire , the volcano , the water ( rain ) , the wind , and the lightning were , and are even now , worshiped .
** in addition , the places where the shimenawa ropes are stretched around include a rice paddy struck by a thunderbolt ( lightning ) .
** the mitamashiro ( spirit replacement ) of a high-ranking kami was also thought to be a shintai .
the imperial household shinto has something to do with this , and the imperial household is said to own the three sacred treasures .
** originally the grand sumo tournament was a shinto ritual dedicated to the imperial family in the imperial household shinto .
as a result , among the ozeki wrestlers , the highest ranking sumo wrestlers , only the chosen ones can wear the yokozuna , a shimenawa rope , as the proof of the shintai of a kami .
** at the yashiro of a shrine the shimenawa ropes are stretched as the proof of the shintai .
most of the shrines of the shrine shinto were originally constructed at the site of himorogi or iwakura .
shrines with a long history often do not have a main shrine building , and the hill or the sacred tree can be the goshintai ( suwa-jinja shrine ) .
in areas with strong folk beliefs to help having babies , a phallic symbol can be a shintai for fertility .
also a ' yashiro ' has existed since ancient times in the shrine shinto ; ruins of shrine buildings that were used for festivals and rituals have been excavated from the sites .
** repose of souls
** repose of souls ( " chinkon " , or " tamashizume " ) refers to the quieting of a persons soul .
today the word ' chinkon ' means to console the soul ( spirit ) of a deceased person , that is to say , it means essentially the same thing as ' to memorialize ' .
however , the word ' chinkon ' was originally read as ' mitamashizume ' , and indicated a shinto ritual performed to repose the soul of a living person in the person ' s body .
in the broader scope of its meaning , the ritual called ' tamafuri ' is included under the repose of souls ; however , in a repose of souls cermony performed in the palace , two types of rituals are performed : the chinkon and tamafuri rituals .
** according to shinto , the soul of a living person is unstable , and if ignored it will become separated from the body .
the ritual for quieting unrestfulness and reposing the soul in the body is called ' tamashizume ' .
on the other hand , the ritual ' tamafuri ' is a ritual performed to stir a sould into an active state from outside of the body .
** repose of souls ceremony
** a repose of souls festival is a ceremony perfomed within the palace on the day before niiname-sai festival ( ceremonial offering by the emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities ) for the repose of the soul of the emperor .
** kayanarumi
** shrines
** some believes it is a male deity , however .
** summary
the name is also written with the chinese characters 賀屋鳴比女 in " engishiki kutaishiki " and " ruijusandaikyaku . "
the name " kayanarumi " is not mentioned in the " kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) or the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , so her origins are unknown .
still , it is believed that kayanarumi is related to torinarumi or nunoshitomitorinarumi ( both are male deities ) , who are mentioned in the genealogy of okuninushi in the " kojiki . "
** asukaniimasu-jinja shrine
- enshrined deity : kayanarumi
kayanaruminomikoto-jinja shrine
- enshrined deity : kayanarumi
daigyojisha shrine ( subordinate to omiwa-jinja shrine )
- enshrined deities : kayanarumi no kami , kotoshironushi no kami , yahirowani
the history is unknown .
and the " kujihongi " ( ancient japanese history ) states ' tsumihayae kotoshironushinokami transformed into yahiro no kumawani to marry the daughter of mishima no mizokuihime , ikutamayorihime , and had a boy and a girl , ' indicating kotoshironushi no kami transformed into yahirowani .
** ichikishimahime
** ichikishimahime ( or itsukishimahime ) is a deity of water that appears in japanese mythology .
in the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , her name is written " 市寸島比売命 " and in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) it is " 市杵嶋姫命 . "
** according to the " kojiki , " ichikishimahime , who was also called sayoribime no mikoto , was the second-born deity and was enshrined at nakatsunomiya shrine , part of munakata taisha shrine ( munakata city , fukuoka prefecture ) .
at present , ichikishimahime is the enshrined deity of hetsumiya shrine , one of the three shrines that make up munakata taisha shrine .
** ichikishima ' refers to ' itsuki shima ' ( the island of worship ) , so ' ichikishimahime ' means ' female ( goddess ) of the island of worship ' .
hetsumiya shrine is not on an island , so the descriptions in the " kojiki " and " nihonshoki " that she is the enshrined deity of the nakatsumiya or okitsumiya shrine are closer to the origin of the name .
she is also the enshrined deity of itsukushima-jinja shrine ( hatsukaichi city , hiroshima prefecture ) , and it is believed that the shrine name ' itsukushima ' is derived from ' ichikishima . '
** later , ichikishimahime was syncretized with the buddhist goddess saraswati ( known in japan as benzaiten ) and worshiped as benzaiten through the honji-suijaku theory , which holds that buddhist deities appear to the japanese as shinto deities .
** ichikishimahime is also enshrined , together with tagitsuhimenomikoto and tagirihimenomikoto , at the nino goden ( the middle one of three shrine buildings ) of usa-jingu shrine in oita prefecture .
** nainokami
** nainokami is a deity of earthquakes from japanese mythology .
** nai refers to earthquakes , so ' nainokami ' is not a shinmei ( name of deity ) but a term of divinity like ' no no kami ' ( the deity of fields ) or ' umi no kami ' ( the deity of the sea ) .
there are no records of nainokami ' s name or origins .
in later periods , legends about the " kanameishi " , a stone which is supposed to suppress earthquakes , at kashima-jingu shrine led to the belief that the shrine ' s central deity , takemikazuchi , was a guardian against earthquakes .
however , neither the " kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) nor the " nihonshoki " mention any connection between takemikazuchi and earthquakes .
there are also theories stating that nainokami is a deity of the jinushigami ( deities of an area of land ) type or that it may have been related to onmyodo ( yin-yang ) beliefs .
** some have suggested that nai-jinja shrine in nabari city , mie prefecture , which is listed in the engishiki ( a 00th century book of laws and regulations ) , was originally dedicated to nainokami of iga province ( now western mie prefecture ) .
at present , the shusaijin ( main enshrined deity ) of this shrine is okuninushi ( chief god of izumo in southern honshu , and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region ) .
** magatama
** magatama ( also written with the characters for " curved jewels " ) have been used for personal adornment in japan since ancient times .
magatama are also called " 曲玉 ( magatama ) " , curved jewels .
** a magatama is formed in the shape of the letter " c " , and is curved , appearing as if it is a jewel that has a tail .
a hole is opened on the rounder end , and a string is passed through the jewel , which is then worn as a necklace .
the end at which the hole has been provided is called the head , the inner curve portion of the jewel the belly , and the outer curve the back .
many magatama are fashioned from jade , agate , quartz and talc , and there are also magatama fashioned from clay and fired in a kiln .
from ancient times , it has been regarded as an object for ' warding off evil and bringing good fortune ' .
** at present , it is thought that ketsujo mimikazari ( an earing resembling chinese glassware called ' ketsu ' ) from the incipient stage of the jomon period represents the original form , and that the magatama discovered at jomon period remains are the oldest ,
the magatama was also transmitted to the korean peninsula , and examples of magatama made from amazonite during the mumon pottery period from the 0th century b . c . to the 0rd century are known .
** throughout the jomon period , the size of the magatama was comparatively small .
** in 0000 , a 0 . 0 cm jade magatama was excavated from the later yayoi period remains at the yotsuba ruins , in itabashi ward , tokyo .
** magatama of jadeite are often found during the excavation of tombs from the early part of the kofun period .
thirty-four large and small sized magatama have been discovered at the imperial mausolea and tombs of koganezuka in izumi city , osaka prefecture .
twenty-six jade magatama are included among these 00 magatama .
** the first two magatama that form an x shape when put together back-to-back discovered in the country were found in remains at bakuro-machi , from the early part of the kofun period .
they were excavated from the ruins at bakuro-machi in yonago city , tottori prefecture .
from an article reported in the sankei news , april 0 , 0000 .
** the yasakani no magatama is included as one of the three sacred treasures ( imperial regalia ) passed along within the imperial family .
in addition , magatama have been excavated at royal tombs in korea , such as those at tomb of king muryong , and the theory that these originated in japan is widely accepted .
** musuhi ( life-producing spirits )
** musuhi , a concept embraced in shinto , refers to a spiritual influence that produces all the things in the universe and helps them develop and complete their cycle .
musuhi can be spelled in chinese word as ' 産霊 , ' ' 産巣日 , ' ' 産日 , ' or ' 産魂 . '
** it is said that the prefix ' musu ' comes from the word ' umusu ( 産むす ) ' meaning ' to arise spontaneously , ' with the letter ' u ' being removed .
the word ' musu ( 生す ) ' in the phrase ' koke musu ( 苔生す ) ' ( moss grows , or to become old like moss grows ) has the same origin .
the suffix ' hi ' represents spiritual and mysterious influence .
in shinto , it is considered that all the things in the universe are produced and develop by the power of ' musuhi ' .
musuhi is one of important briefs in shinto , and the meaning of musuhi was discussed by the study of japanese classical literature after the edo period .
** there are many deities whose " shinmei " ( the name of god ) contains the word ' musuhi ( musubi ) . '
** among the zokasanshin ( three gods of creation ) , two gods have the word ' musuhi ( musubi ) ' in their names : takamimusubi and kamimusubi .
when amaterasu shut herself in " ama no iwato " ( cave of heaven ) , takamimusubi ordered legions of deities to lure amaterasu out and brought her back whereas kamimusubi resuscitated okuninushi , who had been murdered .
from these episodes , we can understand that gods whose names contains the word ' musuhi ' were endowed with power to reinvigorate diminishing souls ( in other words , a symbol of life force ) .
** among eight gods who were enshrined in the " hasshinden " ( eight shrines ) in the imperial court , five gods have the word ' musuhi ( musubi ) ' in their names .
those five gods are : tamatsumemusubi , ikumusubi , and tarumusubi , in addition to the above-mentioned two deities , kamimusubi and takamimusubi .
the word ' iku ' in ikumusubi and the word ' iki ' ( ' life , ' or ' breath ' ) have same origins , whereby those words are used to admire the influence of musuhi .
the word ' taru ' in tarumusubi refers to a state in which a place is filled with the influence of something ( being sufficient ) .
** kagutsuchi ( the kami of fire ) is also known as ' homusubi . '
after giving birth to fire god kagutsuchi , izanami died from burns on her private parts .
raging against the accident , izanagi ( the husband of izanami ) stabbed kagutsuchi to death , but a host of gods were born on this occasion .
homusubi has the word ' musubi ' in his name because he is a god who can produce a host of deities .
from this point , it becomes clear that musuhi can also be defined as a symbol of the continuity of life in that a host of lives are produced even after death .
continuity is , in other word , ' musubi ( a knot , or connection ) .
a similar episode can be seen in the description of wakumusubi in chronicles of japan .
wakumusubi also produced abundance of grain and so on after his death .
** as the third definition of ' musubi , ' the word ' musubi ( 掬び ) ' can be included .
the word ' musubi ( 掬び ) ' has the meaning of ' to take a sip of water from your palms , which you fold like a bowl . '
shinobu orikuchi explains , ' the action of ' mizu o musubu ' ( to take a sip of water from your palms , which you fold like a bowl ) is to take souls and spirits into human body and unite them .
humans who carry out this action can exhibit tremendous power .
in fact , to let souls and spirits get into water and to let them get into human body are the techniques of musuhi . '
this action is also referred to as " misogi " ( purification ceremony ) .
** kegare
** kegare in japanese myths
** shinto and buddhism
** origin of kegare
** from looking down to seeing the unclean
** relation to shinto
** kegare is a notion in buddhism and shinto and means a dirty , bad , not clean state , such as being unclean , impure etc .
originally , it simply referred to becoming injured as a modern term ' kega ( 怪我 ) ( injury ) ' was written in manyo-gana ( a form of syllable used in the manyo-shu or collection of myriad leaves . )
** a difference between ' kegaru ' and ' yogoru ' is as follows :
subjective feeling of impurity
** kegare and sin are often collectively called as ' tsumi kegare ' and while tsumi is caused by man , kegare is thought to arise naturally .
upon attachment of kegare to someone ' s body , it was believed that kegare would disturb the order of both the person and the community the person belonged to and generate troubles for both .
kegare can be removed by misogi or harae ( form of shinto purification . )
tsumi ( sin ) is the same as ' tsutsugami ( harm ) ' and means mental injury or trouble and sadness or sorrow from it .
** refer to the ' hare and ke ' section for more details .
** there are similar notions in other religions or folk beliefs .
refer to the general notions of kegare on this respect .
** izanagi went through misogi after he was back from yominokuni ( hades , realm of the dead , the next world . )
this was an act to remove kegare which had attached to him in yominokuni , and gave birth to a lot of kami ( god ) during the course of misogi .
mihashira no uzuno miko ( three noble children ) were among them .
kami was also born from removed kegare .
** the first appearance of kegare was ' kegare of death ' which was related to the death of tomomewarawa ( servant ) appearing in a tradition where susano directed ama no fuchigoma horse to break into amaterasu ' s residence .
** both shinto and buddhism are conscious of kegare , but the biggest difference between the both is the notion of death , and while shinto considers death and blood as kegare , buddhism does not regard death as kegare like shinto does .
a buddhism funeral may be held at a temple , and a shinto funeral is held at a place other than a shrine which is regarded as the holy precincts .
this depends on what the holy thing is , and salt for purification is intended to remove kegare .
this kegare refers to death itself rather than a dead person .
in buddhism , death represents the rinne ( the wheel of life ) world in reincarnation takes place , and there is no concept to deny this .
it means trying to escape from such a phenomenon .
buddhism dislikes that kegare is accumulated in a form of karma , that is based on logic .
in other religions , there is some logical basis for all things that are disliked such as kegare .
** other notions of kegare ( a sense of discomfort ) which have been established since ancient times in japan can be seen in people ' s ordinary life .
manners in eating meals is one .
** kami ( god ) was mythical and venerable for japanese people ( goryo-shinko ( a folk religious belief of avenging spirits . ) )
people appeased kami , who inspired a sense of fear in them , by enshrining and worshipping them as holy spirits .
the emperor was believed to be from amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) regarded as kososhin ( imperial ancestor ) and a respectful person as well as kami .
such kami and kegare are not compatible , and that is why chozusha ( purification trough ) is placed at a shrine to remove outside kegare from visitors .
** syncretization of shinto with buddhism exists in many places in japan and the ideas and concepts of both are somewhat mixed up or confused ( torii ( an archway to a shinto shrine ) and construction style at a shrine . )
the same mix-up and confusions also apply in kegare .
** it is thought that the notion of kegare was imported in japan during the heian period .
the notion that death , child birth and blood were kegare originated in hinduism , and flowed into buddhism which had arisen in india as well .
particularly , most buddhism imported to japan in the heian period had this thought , and the notion of kegare spread from kyoto to all other places in japan .
** on the other side , after the arrival of the notion of kegare , discrimination against discriminated people changed , in that they were seen as unclean ( to see them kegare . )
it is represented by the fact that the most typical humble people in the edo period were called eta ( meaning much kegare . )
** there were discriminated people called ' hakucho ' ( inferior servants ) in korean peninsula who were engaged in slaughtering cows and horses and leather industry , and in medieval germany , there were cases in which books were burnt in a slaughterhouse of cows and horses .
however , there are objections towards the thought that this type of discrimination is directly connected with shinto .
close relations between discriminated people and the emperor were clarified through research by scholars such as yoshihiko amino , etc .
there is a view that the emperor is an awesome person who has a function of ' kiyome ' ( cleaning of unclean things . )
masao takatori thinks that the notion of ' kegare ' changed because of the notion of uncleanness in buddhism ( " shinto no seiritsu " ( formation of shinto . ) )
** general notion of kegare
a notion corresponding to kegare or uncleanness exists in many cultures on one nature and level or another .
it was an important view for people living before the modern period or in uncivilized areas in which there was no scientific knowledge as we have now .
it was thought that upon physical or mental contact to a thing with kegare , the kegare was infected .
this remains in various religious ceremonies such as purification ceremony , kanjo ( the esoteric buddhist ritual of pouring water on the top of a monk ' s head ) and being christened .
it is believed that a conception of treating sin and kegare in the same way like ' sin and kegare ' in shinto was not a special one in ancient periods .
** typical things with kegare are death , disease , injury , women and all things related to the four mentioned above .
** these are not necessarily absolute kegare , and differ in many cases depending on acts ( e . g . it is alright to touch a certain animal , but eating it is prohibited , etc . )
** the notion of kegare is recognized not only in folk religions but also in many primary religions .
in judaism , various notions of kegare have been determined in detail for a long time , and this affected islam in regard to the food taboo and also have left imprints on many people ' s life styles even in modern times .
a notion of kegare in brahmanism was succeeded by modern hindu and also left imprints on buddhism .
** kinen
** kinen ( incantation ) is a traditional magic ( spell ) in japan .
in shinto , okuninushi no kami and sukunabikona no kami are regarded as the soshin ( ancestor honored as god ) of kinen .
** hojutsu kosetsu , written by nobutomo ban , a scholar of japanese classical literature who lived in the edo period , describes as follows :
** majinai refers to the magic of pronouncing a curse on the original cause in order to bring down harmful results ; noroi ( curse ) is concerned with evil omen only whereas majinai includes both good fortune and evil omen .
** the above description also mentions that the original cause is called ' majimono ' .
** shaku
** shaku is a narrow board held in the right hand when one wears sokutai ( traditional ceremonial court dress ) in japan .
** summary
it originated in china where it is said to have been a board used by a government official for writing memos .
shaku was introduced from china in the sixth century , and it was first used in japan during the imperial court ceremony , wherein a sequence of the ceremony was written down as memos on a piece of paper called shakugami pasted on the back of the shaku .
later shaku came to be used for giving a dignified air to the holder during important ceremonies and shinto rituals .
** there are two types of shaku : geshaku which is made of ivory and mokushaku which is made of wood .
today ' s shinto priests hold mokushaku .
geshaku was made of ivory or rhino horn , and mokushaku was made of wood such as japanese yew and japanese cherry .
** a natural way to read the word ' shaku ' is ' kotsu ' , but since the reading of ' kotsu ' also means ' bones ' and suggests bad omen , the reading of ' shaku ' came to be used .
there are other theories to the reason of reading ' shaku ' .
** since shaku was formally made of hahaso oak ( quercus serrata murray ) , which is read " saku " in chinese ( pronunciation ) , the reading developed into " shaku " .
** the word ' shaku ' came from its length which is one shaku ( unit of distance approximately equal to 00 . 0 centimeters ) .
** shaku and religious services in a shrine
today , shaku are held by a shinto priest to give a dignified air to the holder during a ceremony .
the formal attire under the dress code of shinto priests after the meiji period became the ikan ( traditional formal court dress ) , and it was stipulated that a mokushaku be held as torimono ( symbolic offering ) at the same time .
** tamagushi
** others
** tamagushi means a branch of sakaki tree decorated with shide ( paper cascade ) and yu ( strips of cloth ) and offered before the gods by shinto priests and visitors during shinto rituals .
branches of japanese cedars , fir trees , and oaks are sometimes used instead .
** making an offering of tamagushi before the gods is called tamagushihoten .
tamagushi is offered in the following manner .
** when tamagushi is handed by a shinto priest , the base of tamagushi is held from above by the right hand , and the leaf apex is supported by the left hand .
in doing so , one should keep the left hand ( leaf apex ) at a higher position than the right hand .
** step forward to the front of the desk to make an offering of tamagushi , and carry out ichiyu ( a little bow once ) .
** pull back the right hand so that the base of tamagushi looks your direction ( the leaf apex pointing the altar ) , and shift the left hand to hold the base , and pray .
** hold the leaf apex of tamagushi by the right hand , move tamagushi clockwise so that the base points the altar .
** place tamagushi on the desk , perform nirei nihakushu ichirei ( bowing twice , clapping hands twice , and bowing again ) , make ichiyu , and return to the original seat .
** * some shrines make an offering of tamagushi in a totally different manner from the above description .
furthermore , there are other manners such as ' tamagushihairei ' , ' kendamagushi ' , and ' tatetamagushi ' ( which may have different styles of offering ) .
** in reality , yorishiro ( object to which a spirit is drawn or summoned ) of divine spirit is considered the origin of tamagushi .
** there are different theories as to the origin of the word ' tamagushi ' .
atsutane hirata and others maintain that ' tamagushi ' came to be called so because it was decorated with balls like in the description of the mythology , whereas norinaga motoori maintained the word meant ' tamukegushi ' ( literally , ' pointing towards the altar ' ) .
another theory has it that ' tama ' refers to ' tamashii ' ( spirit ) .
** the above poem depicts colored leaves , which have no shide or yu , as being tamagushi .
** sometimes the money paid to the shrine when requesting a prayer is written as ' tamagushi-ryo ' ( shrine fee ) in addition to ' hatsuho-ryo ' ( ceremony fee ) .
hatsuho-ryo also refers to the money paid in exchange for ofuda ( paper charm ) and omamori ( personal amulet ) , whereas the term tamagushi-ryo is used only for the money paid upon requesting a prayer since it is paid instead of tamagushi .
furthermore , tamagushi-ryo ( or osakaki-ryo ) is written on the cover of the bushugi-bukuro ( envelope for a condolence gift ) upon a shinto funeral .
** there is a place called ' tamagushi ' in osaka which is written using the same kanji ( chinese characters ) .
** in 000 , kushige ( a container used to hold hair accessories , including decorative combs ) was floated down the old yamato river from upstream in the hope of calming wind and flood damage in the kawachi province .
tamakushi-meigu shrine ( present tsuhara-jinja shrine ) was built in the place where the kushige drifted to , and the surrounding area came to be called tamagushi .
** amatsumara
** amatsumara is a deity of ironworking that appears in japanese mythology .
he appears in the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) but not in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
he has none of the titles , such as " kami " or " mikoto , " that are usually given to shinto deities .
** amatsumara appears in the iwatogakure section of the " kojiki , " which relates how the sun goddess , amaterasu , hid in a cave and was lured out uing a mirror and the dancing of amenouzume , the goddess of merriment .
the " kojiki " states that the ' blacksmith , amatsumara was called upon ' but there is no description of what he did .
the sentence before that states that amatsumara was ' using steel from the metal mountain of heaven , ' so he is believed to have been refining the iron used by ishikoridome to make the mirror .
the main text of the " nihonshoki " says that amenouzume was holding an enchanted spear , chimaki no hoko , but there is no description of its maker .
this can be interpreted to mean that amatsumara made the spear ( the first addendum indicates that ishikoridome made the hiboko ( spear ) ) .
** another theory states that since there is no divine title , amatsumara is not the name of a god but a general term for blacksmiths ( or their deified ancestor ) .
** " amatsu " in the name " amatsumara " refers to the amatsukami ( gods of heaven ) , but there are several theories as to the meaning of ' mara . '
** one theory states that ' mara ' comes from ' me-ura ' meaning ' one-eyed , ' a reference to the practice of blacksmiths closing one eye in order to check the iron ' s temperature from its color ( or to an occupational hazard of blacksmiths ) .
** another theory states that ' mara ' is a mongolian word that means iron .
** there is also a theory that blacksmith ' s hammers were compared to a penis and so ' mara , ' a slang word for penis , became part of the name .
** if the first theory is accepted , amatsumara can be held to be the same deity as amenomahitotsu no kami ( the one-eyed kami of heaven ) , who appears in " nihonshoki " and " kogo-shui " ( history of the inbe clan ) .
amenomahitotsu no kami was also a deity of ironworking , and in " kogo-shui , " he made metal weapons at the time of amaterasu ' s hiding away in the cave .
** kiyome
** kiyome means people who were engaged in the disposal of animals and cleaning on behalf of priests who were prohibited to kill animals in a temple .
in the medieval period , kiyome was also used as a synonym for derelict or eta ( the lowest rank of a caste system in japan . )
** ko
** ko is a society organized by people having the same faith .
note , however , the term ' ko ' is used in a wide variety of organizations such as mujin-ko ( beneficial association ) .
** the term ko originally represents ' kogi ( lecture ) ' or ' ko-doku ( reading ) , ' and referred to a group of monks living in the heian period who read and studied buddhist scriptures .
it later came to mean ' ko-kai , ' a buddhist event focused on the reading of buddhist scriptures , and the use of the term spread to a wide variety of buddhist rituals ( such as hoon-ko ( a memorial service for shinran ) ) .
** while this concept of ko spread to the public in the middle ages , many types of faith groups used the term ko in their names .
among ko as faith groups , some were naturally formed in local communities and some were introduced from outside .
some ko of high-class shrines have members even outside the village it is located in .
** ko is also called ' kosha ( a meeting for the purpose of spiritual guidance or for conducting a religious ceremony , or an organization for holding such meetings ) , ' and members of ko are called ' koin . '
for ko operation , officers such as komoto ( host of the ko ) , fuku-komoto ( vice komoto ) , and sewanin ( manager ) are appointed .
they are usually selected from ko members and are appointed by the shrine or temple that the ko has faith in .
** ko that were introduced from outside were originally related to mountain worship .
ascetic buddhist monks from tate-yama mountain traveled across the nation to encourage people to climb sacred mountains , and built sanpai ko ( ko for temple or shrine visits ) at various locations .
following this , a large number of ko for shrine and temple visits were established in various parts of japan .
** use of the concept of ko in beneficial organizations ( such as tanomoshi-ko and mujin-ko ) has been derived from the concept of daisan ko .
in these organizations , they collect money from members but instead of visiting a temple or shrine , they buy lottery tickets or bid in auctions , and money won in lotteries or objects obtained through auction are given to the members .
** chinju gami
** summary
** chinju gami is a ( shinto ) god enshrined to guard a particular building or a certain area of land .
it is often considered to be the same as ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion ) or ubusunagami ( guardian deity of one ' s birthplace ) .
a shrine for chinju gami is called a chinju-sha shrine ( shinto shrine on buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area ) .
** the origin of chinju gami is believed to be garanjin ( tutelary deities of temple compounds ) of china .
japanese temples started to enshrine gods of heaven and earth in order to protect themselves as buddhism spread and syncretism of shinto and buddhism developed .
then , chinju gami started to be enshrined in structures other than temples or certain areas of land .
** then , the jinushi gami was expected to submissively obey the chinju gami and to guard and support its activities ( jinushi gami however sometimes resisted chinju gami and caused a curse ) .
** as time passed , however , the original meaning of chinju gami was forgotten , chinju gami and jinushi gami were confused with each other , and they as a result were syncretized .
chinju gami then were enshrined at places such as temples , residences , shoen ( manor in medieval japan ) , castles , and villages .

there is also ikutamayoribime , who is the wife of the god , omononushi .
the tamayoribime who is enshrined at kamomioya-jinja shrine ( shimogamo-jinja shrine ) is the tamayoribime who appears in the yamashironokuni fudoki .
** isotakeru
** nihonshoki
** sendai kujihongi
** isotakeru is a shinto god appearing in japanese mythology .
his name is also pronounced as itakeru .
he is a child of susanoo ( a god of sea and storms ) , and his younger sisters are the goddesses oyatsuhime and tsumatsuhime .
** according to the descriptions in the " nihonshoki " and the " sendai kujihongi , " isotakeru is worshipped as a god of forestry .
kii province had been an important region for forestry since ancient times and it is believed that isotakeru was worshipped by people in that industry .
** in the first volume of the " nihonshoki , " the fourth issho ( addendum ) of the the eighth section , which describes the defeat of yamatanoorochi ( the eight-forked serpent ) , says as follows .
the issho says as follows .
susanoo behaved wickedly .
accordingly the gods punished him by confiscating his property and banished him .
susanoo then descended to the country called silla ( on the korean peninsula ) with his child named isotakeru no kami , and went to a place called soshimori .
in that place he complained , saying ' i do not want to stay here . '
thus he made a boat from clay and used it to travel to the east , and then he reached mt . torikami located at the upper reaches of hi-kawa river in izumo province .
in that place , there was a man-eating monster serpent .
susanoo defeated the serpent with a sword called amanoha-hakiri no tsurugi .
the sword chipped as he cut the serpent ' s tail .
he cut up the tail to see inside it , and found a mysterious sword there .
susanoo said , ' this cannot pass into my possession . '
therefore he sent amanohukine no kami , who was a fifth-generation descendant of susanoo , to offer it to heaven .
this sword is what is now called kusanagi no tsurugi .
when itakeru no kami first descended from heaven , he brought a large number of tree seeds .
however , he did not sow them in korea , and brought all of them back to japan .
he sowed the seeds all over the country of oyashima ( great myriad islands , which is another name for japan ) starting with tsukushi ( kyushu ) , until finally the whole country was covered with green mountains .
thus itakeru no mikoto is called isaoshi no kami ( the ' deserving god ' ) because of this story .
he is the great god who is enshrined in kii province .
isotakeru brought many tree seeds when descending from heaven but did not sow them in silla , instead taking all of them to japan , where , starting in kyushu , he sowed them throughout yashima ( japan ) .
it is said this is why japan became a country covered with green mountains .
** the fifth issho in the same section says as follows .
the issho says as follows .
susanoo said ' there is gold and silver on the islands of korea . it would not be good if there were no ships in the country where my child rules . '
he pulled out his mustache and beard and threw them , and they became japanese cedar trees .
he pulled out his chest hairs and threw them , and they became japanese cypress trees .
the hairs of his buttocks became podocarpus trees .
his eyebrows became camphor trees .
susanoo ' s child is called isotakeru no mikoto .
his younger sister is oyatsuhime no mikoto
the next sister is tsumatsuhime no mikoto .
these three gods worked hard to sow the seeds .
they are enshrined in kii province .
then susanoo went to mount kumanarinotake and he finally entered nenokuni ( the underworld ) .
the term " 棄戸 " is pronounced " sutahe " ( coffin ) , and the term " 柀 " is pronounced " maki " ( podocarpus ) .
** both the issho versions say he is now enshrined in kii province .
** according to the folklore of izumo , susanoo and his children landed on coast of isotake , in iwami province , which was near to izumo province , and then they left for izumo province .
** susanoo descended from heaven to the place called soshimori , in silla , with his child named isotakeru no kami .
soshimori is the name of a place in silla .
soshimari , seen in the section on goryeo music in the wamyosho ( a famous heian-period japanese dictionary ) is a song that tells of the customs of that place .
after that , he said aloud , ' i do not want to stay here . '
so he made a clay boat and traveled in it to the east .
he reached the place called torikami , which is in the upper reaches of the hi-kawa river in izumo province and the upper reaches of the kaai-kawa river in aki province .
( story of yamatanoorochi ' s defeat omitted )
susanoo entered nenokuni from mount kumanasunomine .
his child , called isotakeru no kami , brought seeds of various types of trees and crops when he descended from heaven , but he brought them back to japan without sowing them in korea .
he eventually started to sow the seeds in tsukushi and then spread them all over the country of oyashima , filling the country with green mountains .
isotakeru no mikoto achieved great things .
he is a great god who is enshrined in kii province .
according to another story , susanoo had three child gods , the child named isotakeru no mikoto , his younger sister , named oyahime no mikoto , and the youngest sister , named tsumatsuhime no mikoto .
also , they worked hard sowing many seeds and moved to kii province .
in other words , they are the gods who are enshrined in this province .
susanoo
this mikoto ( god ) swears with amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) . . . and the god named isotakeru no kami , also known as oyahiko no kami , followed by oyahime no kami and tsumatsuhime no kami .
these three gods are in kii province .
in other words , they are gods who are enshrined by kiinokuni no miyatsuko ( the governor in kii province ) .

** kariginu
** forms and structure
** history of kariginu
** kariginu are informal clothes worn by court nobles in the heian period and afterwards .
" kariginu " literally means hunting clothes , referring to its original usage .
they gradually obtained popularity as informal clothes because they were suitable for physical activities .
as time passed , kariginu came to be used as formal clothes , and became a formal dress for samurai of jushiinoge jiju ( junior forth rank , lower grade chamberlain ) and shosidai ( local governor ) classes , next to hitatare ( court dress ) .
samurai warriors were not allowed to sandai ( pay a visit to the imperial palace ) at all in kariginu , though .
today , kariginu is everyday attire of shinto priests .
** kariginu costume comprises of underwear , sashinuki ( a type of hakama , pleated trousers for formal wear ) or sashiko japanese skirt , and kariginu .
it also includes eboshi ( formal headwear for court nobles ) .
** as kariginu are informal clothes , there was no restriction on the color or pattern of the clothes .
" forbidden colors , " seven colors traditionally reserved for the imperial family and nobility , were avoided .
** a costume of white kariginu and sashinuki with no pattern was called ' joe ' and mainly worn in religious ceremonies .
** kariginu is a cloth with agekubi ( stand round collar ) that has padding called ' erigami ' ( collar paper ) , as ho ( outer robe/vestment ) and noshi ( ordinary robe ) .
the front main panel of kariginu is made of one piece of cloth , that is half ho and noshi , while the sides are not sewn together .
sleeves are sewn to the back main panel to allow the arms to move easily .
hitoe ( a single layer of kimono ) can be seen from the sides , but most shinto priests today don ' t wear hitoe .
** just like on ho , a button on the sleeve of kariginu is called ' kagero ' ( mayfly ) that is passed through a hole .
it distinguishes kariginu from suikan ( everyday garment worn by commoners in ancient japan ) , which is similar to kariginu in its form but its sleeves are fastened by knotted strings .
** straps called ' sodekukuri ' ( straps to turn up one ' s cuffs ) are passed through the sleeves , so cuffs can be narrowed by pulling the straps , as with clothes bag with straps .
young men used wider straps with brighter colors , and the older they became , the more understated the straps became .
** kariginu was worn on hitoe ( or clothes made of awase , lined garment ) on white kosode ( a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing by the upper classes ) .
a belt was made of the same cloth called ' ateobi , ' and a headwear was tateeboshi ( formal headwear with a peak for court nobles ) .
today , hakama for ordinary kariginu costume is sashinuki ( a type of hakama with strings in the lower sleeve edge to be adjusted ) or sashiko ( a type of hakama cut to the length of an ankle ) .
up to the muromachi period , however , lower-ranking nobles wore light karibakama ( hunting hakama ) that were made of six pieces ( sashinuki was with eight pieces ) of white hemp .
some nobles of further lower ranking used four-piece karibakama .
** the origin of kariginu is hoi , a fashion of middle-class people in the capital .
as the kanji letter " 布 ( nuno ) " ( cloth ) refers , hoi was originally plain clothes of hemp , but nobles chose these clothes for hunting with a falcon because these were suitable for such activity .
in the early heian period , kariginu were ordinary clothes worn by retired emperors and nobles .
** in this trend , more sophisticated fabric such as figured silk was used for kariginu .
however , kariginu were informal clothes worn for daily lives , so nobles were not allowed to pay a visit to the imperial palace in kariginu .
** in the mid-heian period , the value and aesthetic called ' miyabi ' ( refinement ) spread as the kokufu bunka ( indigenous japanese culture ) flourished .
** nobles exercised their ingenuity in selecting the colors of outer and lining fabrics ; which resulted in ' irome , ' giving elegant names to combinations of fabrics in which the color of lining fabrics could be faintly seen through thin outer silk .
in case of higher-ranking nobles , however , they were regarded as elders after their ' celebration of age 00 ' and allowed to use only white lining fabrics .
** in the insei period ( during the period of the government by the retired emperor ) in the end of the heian period , it became common for nobles to visit in ( retirement palace ) in kariginu , like in noshi .
** the retired emperor himself wore kariginu , so nobles felt free to wear kariginu after the ceremony of ' hoihajime . '
it was around this period when white kosode were worn as underwear .
** in the early-modern samurai society , kariginu were acknowledged as formal dress .
** today , kariginu is worn by shinto priests as everyday attire .
** himorogi
** himorogi is an object that is designated as yorishiro ( representative of a divine spirit ) to enshrine a divine spirit temporarily when a festival is held in a place other than a shrine or a household shinto altar .
himorogi is formed by placing a frame on an eight-legged table and a sakaki branch at the center of the frame .
the sakaki branch is decorated with shide and yu ( fiber of kozo ( paper mulberry ) ) .
** since ancient times , japanese people have believed in divine spirits residing in nature including mountains , rocks , trees , and the sea , and regarded them as religious objects .
therefore , in ancient shinto , each festival was held by inviting a divine spirit one at a time instead of building shrines and enshrining gods in the building of the shrine .
to invite a divine spirit , a giant tree was surrounded by tamagaki ( fence ) and shimenawa ( sacred rice-straw ropes ) to keep the tree sacred .
in the ancient times , these places were called himorogi .
this evergreen come to be called himorogi .
today , himorogi is used in ground-breaking ceremonies .
** in summary , " himorogi " means a tree where a divine spirit descends from the heaven , or yorishiro of god .
** * heresy : himorogi means a tall tree that can be a landmark for rendezvous , such as a japanese cypress , needle juniper , or pine tree .
it means a tree to meet or gather .
it should be noted , however , that ' ki ' at the end of ' himoroki ' differs in phonetics from ' ki ' ( tree ) of otsurui ( second class ) in ancient special kana usage , so their origins have no relation with each other .
** a kanji letter ' 籬 ' refers to a fence , especially the one made of bamboo .
on the other hand , another kanji letter referring to a fence , ' 垣 ' originally refers to the one made of stones , but today only ' 垣 ' is used as a kanji for common use referring to both types of fence .
** kanji of himorogi ' 神籬 ' was originally read as ' kamigaki ' or ' mizugaki . '
** although the japanese reading of chinese characters ' 胙 , ' ' 膰 , ' and ' 燔 ' is also ' himorogi , ' these characters originally referred to meat that was offered to the god .
this is a chinese custom , because there was no such custom in japan from ancient times to the present .
it means that these chinese characters were imported to japan where the entity of these characters did not exist .
it is regarded that these characters were read as ' himorogi ' because offerings to the god had been called as ' himorogi ' at some time .
** masakaki
** masakaki is a ceremonial implement that is placed on both sides of an altar at shinto rituals .
a sakaki plant is placed on the head of five-color ( green , yellow , red , white , blue ) silk streamer and three sacred imperial treasures are hooked on .
a sword is hooked on the left masakaki and a mirror and a magadama ( comma-shaped bead ) are on the right .
** the five colors of the silk streamer refers to the five elements that compose the universe described in the theory of five elements in yin-yang : wood , fire , earth , metal , and water .
** at shinto funerals , masakaki with yellow and white streams are used .
** hosuseri no mikoto
** hosuseri no mikoto is a shinto god in japanese mythology .
he appears only in the kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) .
** hosuseri no mikoto was a child of the god ninigi and the goddess konohanasakuyabime .
he was named ' hosuseri ' because he was born while the fire was raging ( one of the chinese characters in his name means " fire , " and another means " force " ) .
his elder brother is called hoderi and his younger brother is called hoori .
** suseri , which is also part of the name of other gods such as suseribime , means ' proceed , ' and so the name ' hosuseri ' means ' progress of the growth of an ear of rice . '
** hosuseri no mikoto appears in his birth scene only and then is not mentioned again .
some people think that having a god who does nothing keeps the balance of power between two gods who have opposite characteristics , umisachihiko ( hoderi no mikoto ) and yamasachihiko ( hoori no mikoto ) .
the story about amenominakanushi no kami ( a god ruling the center of heaven ) and the story about tsukuyomi ( a god of the moon ) have the same structure .
** the main account explains that hosusori no mikoto is the ancestor of the hayato ( an ancient tribe in kyushu ) , and the eighth issho describes the exploits that are regarded as hoderi no mikoto ' s in the " kojiki " .
in addition , the second and the sixth issho say that hosuseri no mikoto is the eldest child .
** amenomahitotsu no kami
** summary
** ichimokuren
** amenomahitotsu no kami is a shinto god of iron manufacture and blacksmiths who appears in japanese mythology .
he appears in the " kogoshui " ( history of the inbe clan ) , the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , and the " harimanokuni fudoki " ( records of the culture and geography of harima province ) .
he is also known as amenomahitotsune no mikoto and amenokushimahitotsu no mikoto .
he has something to do with daidara-bocchi ( a giant in japanese mythology ) .
** according to the " kogoshui , " amenomahitotsu no kami is a child of amatsuhikone no mikoto .
he made swords , axes , and bronze bells during the ' iwato-gakure , ' when amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , hid herself in a cave after a fight with her brother .
he worked as a blacksmith to make the necessary items when the god omononushi was enshrined .
the document also says that during the reign of emperor sujin , a descendant of amenomahitotsu no kami and a descendant of ishikoridome ( the ancestral goddess of mirror makers ) recast the sacred mirror .
in the " kogoshui , " he is described as the ancestor of the inbe clans in tsukushi province and ise province , and it also mentions some relationship to futodama ( another ancestral deity of the inbe clan ) .
** he is a god of blacksmithing and is thought to be the same god as amatsumara , who is described as a smith in the iwato-gakure section of the " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) .
the same thing can be said about amatsumara because the ' mara ' in ' amatsumara ' is derived from the word ' meura , ' which also means ' one eye ' .
** amenomahitotsu no kami appears under the name of amenomahitotsu no mikoto in the section on the takanokori region in the " harimanokuni fudoki " ( the topography of harima province ) .
it is believed that this myth represents a close relationship between agricultural people and metalworkers .

** ichimokuren is regarded as a god who controls the weather and , in the edo period , people frequently prayed to him for rain and for protection against shipwrecks in ise bay .
kunio yanagida concludes that this belief originated in sailors at sea on ise bay using the appearance of mt . tado to predict changes in the weather .
** according to a legend from ise , owari , mino , and hida provinces , a windstorm occurred when ichimokuren left the shrine and ran wild , and it is believed that the description in the encyclopedia was derived from this folklore .
the main building of ichimokuren-jinja shrine does not have a door , and it is said this is to enable ichimokuren to go in and out of the shrine anytime he wants in order to show his divine power .
** ukemochi no kami
** description according to mythology
** explanation
** " ukemochi no kami " is a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
she does not appear in kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , and appears only in the eleventh " alternate writing " of the chapter on kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) of nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
she is generally believed to be a goddess .
** amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) ordered tsukuyomi to go take a look at a goddess called ukemochi no kami in ashihara no nakatsukuni ( literally , " central land of reed plains " , which refers to the human world ) .
tsukiyomi no mikoto became angry , saying ' how filthy you are to make me eat something you spit out of your mouth , ' and killed her with a blade .
upon hearing this amaterasu omikami became angry , and said she no longer wanted to see tsukiyomi no mikoto .
that is why the moon and sun appear separately for night and day .
** amaterasu omikami sent amenokumahito to ukemochi no kami , but ukemochi no kami had passed away .
when amenokumahito brought all of these back , amaterasu omikami was delighted , and used these as seeds in the fields , believing that they were foods necessary for people to live .
** this setsuwa ( anecdote ) is the myth surrounding the origin of food in japanese mythology , and is a hainuwele myth-style setsuwa seen mainly in southeast asia and all over the world .
in kojiki , a similar setsuwa exists for susano and oogetsuhime .
therefore , ukemochi no kami is sometimes believed to be the same god as oogetsuhime .
additionally , she is believed to be the same god as ukanomitama , who is also a shokumotsu-shin ( the god of foodstuffs ) , and is sometimes enshrined in inari-jinja shrine instead of ukanomitama-no-kami .
** uke in the shinmei ( name of god ) has the same root as ' uke ' in toyoukebime and ' uka ' in ukanomitama-no-kami , and means food .
** not only because she is a shokumotsu-shin , but also because ' horses and cattle were born from her head , ' she is also considered to be the god of cattle and horses .
komagata-jinja shrine , which is common in eastern japan enshrines ukemochi no kami as the god of horses , and is also viewed as equal to bato kannon ( horse-headed kannon ) because of the ' horse from head ' incident .

as a shinmei ( name of god ) , it is called amenoohabari-no-kami .
it is also referred to as itsunoohabari .
** in the chapter of kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) in kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , it appears as the name of totsuka no tsurugi ( long sword ) used by izanagi to kill kagutsuchi .
it is written that its other name was amenoohabari .
gods such as takemikazuchi related to fire , thunder , and sword were born from kagutsuchi ' s blood on the amenoohabari .
** amenoohabari-no-kami blocked the road by pulling the water from amenoyasukawa , and since the other gods could not go there , amenokaku-no-kami was dispatched as an envoy .
itsunoohabari-no-kami responded that takemikazuchinoo-no-kami is more qualified , so takemikazuchinoo-no-kami was dispatched to ashihara no nakatsukuni .
** when takemikazuchi-no-kami appears in the main body of the chapter on the conquest of ashihara no nakatsukuni in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , it is described that it is the grandchild of itsunoohashiri-no-kami iv , a god living in amenoiwaya .
itsunoohashiri-no-kami is believed to be another name for amenoohabari-no-kami .
** ohabari ' ( 尾羽張 ) means ' ohabari ' ( 尾刃張 ) , which is a sword with wide blades on both sides at the tip .
ame ' indicates that it has something to do with takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
itsu ' ( 伊都 , 稜威 ) means power .
ohashiri ' means ' saohashiru ' ( the sword comes out of the sheath on its own ) indicating that it is a sharp blade .
** kataku rokushin
** kataku rokushin is a generic name for the six gods ( shinto ) representing ( or protecting ) a house in shinto .
** kataku rokushin indicates the materials and structure of buildings .
all six gods were born as children of izanagi and izanami after ogotooshio-no-kami was born first during kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) , after kuni-umi ( the birth of ( the land ) of japan ) in kojiki ( the records of ancient matters ) .
** iwatsuchibiko-no-kami
the first to be born was iwatsuchibiko-no-kami .
it represents the materials for a house , stones and soil ( plaster ) .
** iwasuhime-no-kami
the second was iwasuhime-no-kami .
iwasu means sand and stone , and since the former was a male god with ' biko , ' it is believed that this was the goddess that made these gods a pair .
** " koshi-den " describes that these two gods are the other name for uwatsutsunoo-no-kami .
" shinmeiko " describes that iwatsuchibiko-no-kami is the god of stones and iwasuhime-no-kami is the god of sand .
** otohiwake-no-kami
the third was otohiwake-no-kami .
oto ' is the entrance/exit of a house .
the gender is unknown .
in " kojikiden " ( commentaries on the kojiki ) , it is described as a god confused with naobi no kami .
" shinmeiko " describes that it is one of the gods of gates .
** amenofukio-no-kami
the fourth is amenofukio-no-kami .
fuki ' describes the movement of thatching the roof .
in " kojikiden , " it is interpreted as the same god as ibukidonushi appearing in oharae no kotoba , due to its name .
in " shinmeiko , " it is the god of rooftops .
** oyabiko no kami
oyabiko no kami , who was the fifth to be born , represents the roof that has been thatched .
the shinmei ( name of god ) comes from ' oaya , ' which means ' major disaster , ' with the ' a ' removed , and it is the same god as magatsuhi no kami ( evil gods ) , the god of disaster .
** kazamotsuwakenooshio-no-kami
the last to be born was kazamotsuwakenooshio-no-kami .
according to its shinmei , this god is believed to have been placed at the end of kataku rokushin as a god related to wind , or god protecting the house from storm wind .
however , with regards to god of wind , there is shinatsuhiko born later , so some say ' kaza ' of kazamotsuwakenooshio-no-kami is simply a substitute character , and it is not a god of wind .
in " kojikiden , " it is described that this note was mistakenly inserted later , and that it is read ' kazaketsuwakeoshiwo . '
additionally , in " kojikiden , " it is considered the same god as sokotsutsuo-no-kami , or hayasasura-hime from oharae no kotoba .
** oharae no kotoba
** oharae no kotoba is a norito ( shinto prayer ) that is used in shinto religious service .
it is also called nakatomi no harae kotoba ( nakatomi no harae for short ) or nakatomi saimon .
** it was originally a norito that was chanted in oharae ( the great purification ) held on the last day of every june and december to purify sins and impurities .
( here sins refer to those regarded as " sins " in the concept of shinto and they not necessarily crimes . )
it is also called nakatomi harae because the nakatomi clan read the words of purification to the emperor at the suzaku-mon gate in kyoto .
there had been different prayers for june and december ceremonies , but only the one for june survived .
** the oharae no kotoba that is used today is based on the norito in " minazuki-no-tsugomori-no-oharae . "
** regarding its origin , kamo no mabuchi argued that it could be traced back to the emperor tenchi and emperor tenmu ' s era , whereas norinaga motoori stated that was the emperor monmu ' s era .
both of them stated that the original text existed before the specified era .
** at first , the words of the great purification were recited for those assembled for the great purification , but this ritual changed into words presented before the deities .
in the medieval period shinto amalgamated with onmyodo ( yin-yang divination ) and esoteric buddhist teachings , and it was believed that by saying these words one could obtain merit similar to those obtainable from the yin-yang spell or buddhist scriptures .
also , from the belief that the more often these words were recited the more merit one could receive , this ritual was presented by reciting the ritual words thousands or even ten-thousand times .
to make the prayer easier to chant , ' saiyo no nakatomi no harae ' ( essential words of the purification rituals of the nakatomi ) and ' saijo no nakatomi no harae ' ( greatest words of the purification ritual of the nakatomi ) were created .
these words were especially venerated by buddhist shinto and confucian shinto scholars , and commentaries of oharae such as " nakatomi harae kunge " and " nakatomi harae fusuiso " were written .
** today , the word of purification is chanted by visitors to shrines at oharae .
it is also chanted before the alter everyday at shrines under jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) .
in addition to jinja-honcho , various denominations of shinto and some of new religious schools of shinto sect use oharae no kotoba .
however , the contents have been altered from the description in the engishiki , so it varies from sect to sect .
** contents
oharae no kotoba can be divided into two parts , the first and latter parts , based on the contents .
** the first part starts with the text to order the imperial family and all the officials participating the ritual to listen to the norito carefully .
these are remains of the fact that the original words of purification were meant to be chanted for the participants .
therefore , this part is omitted from the jinja-honcho ' s words of purification today .
then , japanese mythology was told from the conquest of ashihara no nakatsukuni ( another word for the country or the location of japan ) to tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) and the governance by the grandson .
next , sins committed by the people of the country are listed as ' amatsu-tsumi ' ( heavenly sins ) and ' kunitsu tsumi ' ( sins other than amatsu-tsumi ) .
and it describes how to purify such sins when they are committed .
** in the latter part of oharae no kotoba , it is described how sins and impurities are extinguished .
the process of extinction of sins and impurities is described with various metaphors , and then how these sins were extinguished by four haraedo no kami ( gods for the great purification ) .
** amatsunorito no hutonoritogoto
the last of the first part stated , ' chant amatsunorito no hutonoritogoto ' ( the heavenly norito prayers and the divination norito prayers ) , but there is no description of the contents of such norito .
there have been a discussion on what this term refers to since the edo period when the study of japanese classical literature rose .
** norinaga motoori stated in his " obarai no kotoba goshaku " ( after explication on the words of the great purification ) that the term refers to oharae no kotoba itself .
kamo no mabuchi stated a similar opinion in " norito ko " ( on norito prayers ) .
the ministry of interior that had jurisdiction over shinto shrines in prewar times adopted this theory , and so does jinja-honcho that follows the precedent .
jinja-honcho decided to place a break between the first and latter parts without citing anything .
** there is another theory , however , stating that the term refers to a secret prayer handed down from the age of the gods , and because its secrecy it was not described in the engishiki .
in " amatsunorito ko " ( on amatsu norito prayers ) , he stated that the norito was the word that izanagi ( the male who invites ) said when he performed misogiharae ( form of shinto purification ) in tsukushi no himuka no tachibana no odo no awakihara .
atsutane showed what was ' amatsunorito no hutonoritogoto ' by researching and gathering prayers for misogiharae that were passed on to many shinto shrines and sects .
the type of ' amatsunorito no hutonoritogoto ' presented by atsutane is adopted as ' amatsunorito ' by many shinto groups that don ' t belong to the jinja-honcho .
this prayer is chanted between the first and latter sections of oharaenokotoba as well as used separately as the word for purification .
** ogotooshio-no-kami
** " ogotooshio-no-kami , ohogotooshiwo-no-kami " is a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
** in kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , he was the first god born between izanagi and izanami during kamiumi ( birth of the gods ) after completing the kuni-umi ( the birth of ( the land ) of japan ) .
** the shinmei ( name of god ) is often interpreted as ' the male god who completed an important matter , ' describing that the great task of kuni-umi was completed .
** onusa ( shinto )
** onusa is one of the instruments used for purification at religious services of shinto .
a shide ( paper streamer ) or asao ( hemp rope ) is attached to the tip of a sakaki or plain wood stick .
ones made with a plain wood stick are also called " haraegushi . "
** a word ' onusa ' is originally a polite term for ' nusa . '
nusa ' refers to an offering made to a god or a thing used to purify the sin .
hemp and yu ( fiber of kozo ( paper mulberry ) ) were mainly used , as well as clothes and paper in more recent years .
that is the reason why clothes and paper used in shinto rituals are called " onusa . "
in addition to the meaning of an instrument for purification , the kanji characters " 大麻 " also refers to talisman distributed by ise-jingu shrine , called jingu taima ( in this case , the reading of ' 大麻 ' is ' taima ' ) .
** it is said that waving onusa to the left , right , and left again to the person or object to be purified transfers impurities from them to the onusa .
in ancient times , the person to be purified pulled onusa by hand to transfer impurities .
in more recent times , onusa was waved to people as to objects .
** in some cases , a shinto priest may ( pretend to ) sprinkle hot salt water with a small sakaki after purification with onusa is done .
** there are also rituals in which a shinto priest put onusa itself into the boiling salt water in a pot and wave the onusa to pray for a perfect state of health .
therefore , it is regarded that onusa was originally used like a brush to wash the body .
** shinshi ( divine servant )
** shinshi ( divine servant ) is , in shinto , an animal specified as a messenger ( servant ) of god .
also called ' kami no tsukai ' ( a familiar spirit ) .
sometimes it is regarded as a god itself .
** tales of special animals acting on behalf of god to transmit the divine will are seen in japanese mythology .
in another episode from emperor kogyoku in " nihonshoki , " the cries of monkeys were taken as omens of good and ill fortune , since they were considered ' servants of the great goddess of ise . '
** with time , animal familiars took on fixed identities in episodes of mythology of relevant gods or in shrine lore , and it became customary to feed those animals in the shrine ' s precincts .
in later ages , a god ' s animal familiar might be popularly worshiped as a representation of the god itself , as seen in the case of the fox at inari-jinja shrines .
this phenomenon likely arose due to the perception of such animals as unusual spiritual beings , irrelevant to their respective gods .
** the following table shows examples of shinshi animals .
** shide
** shide ( 紙垂 ) is also expressed in kanji simply with 垂 or 四手 .
the word ' shide ' is the conjunctive form of a verb ' shizu , ' and has the same origin as ' shidareru ' ( hang ) .
** there are a variety of schools and methods to fold and cut the strips .
the best known schools include yoshida , shirakawa , and ise , as shown in the right figure .
while those shown in the figure are common ones , there are also those with two or eight folds .
** shide attached to tamagushi , haraegushi , or gohei are tools of purification , but when shide are suspended from shimenawa demarcating sacred or ritual space , they serve to symbolize a sacred border .
a yokozuna ( grand champion ) of sumo wrestling wears a shimenawa festooned with shide around his ornamental belt during the ring-entrance ceremonies of a sumo tournament .
** nyakuichioji
** " nyakuichioji " is a god ( shinto ) from syncretism of shinto and buddhism .
it is also called nyakuoji .
** the honji-butsu ( original buddhist divinity ) of nyakuichioji is the eleven-faced kannon ( goddess of mercy ) , and was equated with amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) or ninigi .
it is enshrined in the fourth hall in kumano-hongu-taisha shrine and kumano-hayatama-taisha shrine , and the fifth hall in the kumano-nachi-taisha-shrine ( both are called ' wakamiya ' today , and are believed to be amaterasu omikami ) .
** along with the spread of kumano belief nationwide , kanjo ( ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location ) of kumano gongen occurred in various locations , but in many cases , kanjo of nyakuichioji alone were performed .
many places changed ' nyakuichioji ' to amaterasu omikami or ninigi in response to the separation of buddhism and shintoism , but some shrines continue to enshrine ' nyakuichioji . '
** oji-jinja shrine of kita ward , tokyo .
** nyakuichioji-jinja shrine of omachi city , nagano prefecture .
kanjo from ki province .
** a shrine in tanabe city , wakayama prefecture .
it does not exist today , but a monument of nyakuichiojigongen stands in the remained site .
** the old name of susamioji-jinja shrine in susami-cho , nishimuro-gun , wakayama prefecture was ' nyakuichiojigongen-sha shrine . '
** the forest of nyakuichioji-jinja shrine in nyakuoji , fujieda city , shizuoka prefecture
** chimata-no-kami
** chimata ( 岐 , also written 巷 ) or tsuji is a place where the roads diverge or cross .
they were believed to be places where not only people , but also gods come and go .
some gods are evil gods or evil spirits , and chimata-no-kami was enshrined to prevent these from invading .
thus , it is also referred to as sai-no-kami ( god of keeping out evil spirits ) .
** this god is considered to be same god as sarutahiko in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) and " kogo-shui " ( history of the inbe clan ) .
** in " kojiki , " in the scene of izanagi ' s misogi , tsukitatsufunado-no-kami was born from the first cane thrown .
** later , it was syncretized with doso-shin ( traveler ' s guardian deity ) , the god of road , introduced from china .
from there , doso-shin came to be equated with sarutahiko .
additionally , it was equated with buddhist jizo bosatsu ( jizo bodhisattva ) .
** yamatonookuni tamanokami
** " yamatonookuni tamanokami " is a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
it is also written 日本大国魂神 .
it is the enshrined deity of oyamato-jinja shrine ( tenri city , nara prefecture ) .
** it appears in the article of b . c . 00 in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
the two gods , amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) and yamatonookuni tamanokami were enshrined in the imperial court , but the emperor feared the divine power of the two gods , and decided to enshrine them outside the imperial court .
amaterasu omikami was entrusted to toyosuki iribime no mikoto , and enshrined in kasanui no mura of yamato province .
yamatonookuni tamanokami was entrusted to nunakiirihime-no-mikoto for enshrinement , but the hair fell and the body became thin , and could not be enshrined .
it is described that later , omononushi was enshrined .
on december 00 , b . c . 00 , taneko ota became the chief priest enshrining omononushi-no-mikoto , and nagaochi became the chief priest enshrining okunitamano-kami .
** the origin of this god is not described .
since ' okunitama-no-okami ' is among the other names for okuninushi , some say yamatonookuni tamanokami is the same god as okuninushi-no-kami .
in " oyamato-jinja chushinjo , " it is described as the aramitama ( god ' s rough soul ) of onamuchi no kami ( okuninushi-no-kami ) .
however , the " kojikiden " ( commentaries on the kojiki ) by norinaga motoori denies the theory equating this god with okuninushi-no-kami .
one theory has it that it is the jinushigami ( god of an area of land ) of yamato province , due to its shinmei ( name of god ) .
** jotoshiki ( the roof-laying ceremony )
** jotoshiki is a religious service of shinto for building a new house in japan .
it is also called muneage , tatemae , or tatemai .
jotoshiki is also held in buddhism .
** this is a ceremony to pray for the safety of the building after its completion .
it is usually held when the basic structure including pillars , ridges , and beams is completed and a ridgepole is raised into place .
unlike other religious services at the shrines , the method and order of jotoshiki are not clearly defined and vary from region to region .
the variation includes : a jotoshiki held at an alter placed on the roof ; an alter is placed on the roof but the ceremony is held on the ground ; and both alter and ceremony are on the ground .
jinja honcho ( association of shinto shrines ) has established a standardized version for the jotoshiki in its ' shosaishiki yoko ' ( outline of various ceremonies ) .
the ritual proceeds first with shubatsu ( purification ceremony ) , koshin ( the invocation of the god to be present at the ritual ) , kensen ( the presentation of the rice offerings ) ; and then the recitation of a norito ( shinto prayer ) .
as with other shinto rituals , the ceremony finishes with a ritual bow , tessen ( a ritual scattering of rice offerings ) , shoshin ( the invocation of the god to withdraw ) and naorai ( feast ) .
** this last process is the origin of the following ceremony to be called jotoshiki or muneage shiki .
** this ceremony may be held for a reinforced-concrete building when its main structure is completed .
** kujirazuka
** kujirazuka is a mound enshrining the whales that were washed up ashore on the beach , and is a uniquely japanese custom .
** summary
they are seen at kagata-jinja shrine in shinagawa , tokyo , kujira-jinja shrine in miyake-jima island , tokyo , etc .
** since the influx of whales and the influx of schools of fish coincide , whales were believed to have spiritual power , and were used as pilots .
** examples
they exist along the coasts nationwide .
** oshu ( northern honshu , the region encompassing mutsu and dewa provinces )
the case of karakuwa-cho , kesennuma city , miyagi prefecture is as follows .
** on a stormy day , two white whales carried a boat which was about to sink , to the shore by supporting it from both sides .
since then , people of karakuwa-cho have not eaten whales for generations .
** in the precincts of misaki-jinja shrine in karakuwa-cho , there remain several stone monuments of ' kujirazuka ' as memorial service for whales .
this is not the origin of the previously mentioned tradition , but is what remains from the days of whaling .
it is believed that after the end of whaling , the tradition above was born as an interpretation of the kujirazuka .
** yoshu ( iyo province )
the case of akehama-cho , seiyo city , ehime prefecture is as follows .
** there are three kujirazuka in the akehama-cho , seiyo city area ( former akehama-cho ) , and the kujirazuka in the takayama district is the most well-known .
it is on the roadside of the national route facing the ocean , between takayama-shuraku village , where the akehama general branch of the city exists , and osozu coast .
this place was called maruishiajiro in ancient times .
** its origin dates back to june 00 , 0000 , when a large whale was washed up on this coast .
they had been suffering due to a great famine called ( great ) tenpo famine , but thanks to this whale , the villagers managed to escape starvation .
the villagers were grateful , and showed respect , calling it kujira-sama .
a kaimyo ( posthumous buddhist names ) , rino-inden hokkaizenka-daikoji , was given , and was carefully enshrined .
date munetada-ko , the lord of uwajima domain , wrote the inscription on the gravestone .
the kaimyo , inden daikoji , is tono-sama ( a person with higher rank ) class of the time , and is very rare nationwide .
** designated as important tangible folk cultural property by the town .
** kujira-jinja shrine
** suwa-jinja shrine
it is located in nagasaki city , nagasaki prefecture , and dedicates an event called ' nagasaki-kunchi festival ' that imitates whaling .
refer to nagasaki-kunchi festival for details .
** hachioji-gu shrine
it is in tosayamada-cho , kami city , kochi prefecture .
originally , it was built in a kanjo ( ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location ) of a branch shrine of hachioji-gu shrine in omi to former hachioji , meiji-mura in 0000 .
it was relocated to its current location in 0000 , and until today , remains the ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion ) of a whaling group , ukitsu-gumi , continuing from edo period .
it is a shrine , but whale ihai ( ancestral tablets ) are dedicated .
** kujira-jinja shrine
it is in sabigahama , ako , miyake-mura , tokyo .
there is no formal name , and it is simply called kujira-jinja shrine .
it began when the whale bone was buried and a hokora ( a small shrine ) was built to show gratitude .
** kujira torii
kujira torii ( an archway to a shinto shrine ) is a torii of a shrine made of whale bones ( mainly ribs ) .
** the oldest in japan is the torii of ' ebisu no miya ' in taiji-cho , wakayama prefecture .
the five locations above are all directly or indirectly ( base for whaling , etc . ) related to whaling .
** awashima no kami
** awashima no kami is a god ( shinto ) in shinto and japanese folk religion .
there are temples called awaji-do temple , enshrining awashima no kami in various locations .
** awashima no kami is believed to be a god with miraculous efficacy for various things related to women , such as healing of female disorders , smooth delivery , pregnancy , improvement of sewing skills , and memorial service for dolls .
** there are various traditions on the substance of awashima no kami ( awashima myojin ) .
the dominant theories are the following three .
** the first theory is that it was sukunabikona .
** the second theory is that it was the empress of sumiyoshi sanjin ( sumiyoshi three deities ) .
awashima no kami was the sixth child of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) who married sumiyoshi myojin , but was exiled to awashima when she contracted a female disorder .
thus , she took an oath to save people suffering from female disorders .
** the third theory is that ' awashima ' appearing in japanese mythology was awashima no kami .
in the chapter on kuni-umi ( the birth of ( the land ) of japan ) , ' awashima ' appears as the second child of the two gods , izanagi and izanami .
however , like the first child , the child was disabled , and was exiled on a boat made of reed , and not counted in the number of children .
** the ' exiled on a boat ' part is common among the second and third theories .
sukunabikona no kami also appeared on a boat from far away across the sea in the mythology , so there is a commonality between them that they came by boat .
** norai ( feast )
** naorai is an event that is held at the conclusion of a festival at the shrine where everyone who assembled for the shinto ritual is made to drink sacred sake and eat the sacred food ( a ritual to share drink and food ) .
although it is generally considered to be a closing party after a ritual , the naorai is actually one of the constituent elements of the ritual .
** it is the same act carried out by people who eat food and drink sake that are offered to their ancestors ' grave after paying a visit to the grave .
sharing the food and drink taken by the divine spirits is an act to strengthen the connection with divine spirits , to be given the power of these spirits , and to expect their protection .
it also proves that the food and alcohol offered to the gods are edible .
the word " naorau " is used as a verb when a person receives mochi or other food from a shrine .
it has a similar meaning to " naorai . "
** jinja saishiki ' ( rules for ritual procedure at shrines ) by the jinja honcho ( association of shinto shrines ) specifies that the naorai should be performed at any kind of religious festival or ritual .
the book also defines a specific procedure of the naorai .
some rituals have their original procedures of the naorai derived from a tradition .
** in many cases , vegetables and fish of the season are offered to the god and then cooked for the naorai .
that is why the naorai dishes of some shrines are the same as their local cuisine .
** in some rituals , worshippers have a meal with the god .
in most rituals , however , the fixed offerings are served and therefore are not not considered to be naorai .
** the word ' naorai ' is usually thought to derive from ' nahoriahi . '
it means to the end of saikai ( a period of purifying body and mind for ritual ) and returning to everyday life .
shinobu orikuchi stated a theory that ' naorai ' would refer to the ritual to worship the naobi no kami ( god of purification ) at the conclusion of a ceremony , as an apology for any offences committed during the ceremony .
another interpretation identifies the first character with the idea of sitting down before a table set for a meal , and the second character with the idea of ' all meeting together . '
it states that , if naorai means ' after the conclusion of the ceremonies , people partake of the sacred sake and food offerings presented to the god , ' then it does not have any element or meaning of ending purification .
** wakahirume no mikoto
** " wakahirume no mikoto " is a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
she is known as the enshrined deity of ikuta-jinja shrine ( chuo ward , kobe city ) and tamatsushima-jinja shrine ( wakayama city , wakayama prefecture ) .
** in japanese mythology , she first appears in the first " alternate writing " transmitted by " nihonshoki " in chapter 0 of the jindaiki ( records of the age of the gods ) , vol . 0 .
when she was weaving a garment of gods in a imihatadono in takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , susano who saw her skinned a horse from the tail and threw it in the room .
startled wakahirume no mikoto fell from the loom and died hurting her body with the shuttle in her hand .
hearing this , amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) hid in the ama no iwato ( cave of heaven ) .
" kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) does not specify the name , but describes that a hataorime ( a woman weaving ) in the sky died when she was stabbed in her genitals with a loom , and these are considered the same tradition .
** a god with this name appears next in the jindaiki .
when the boat returning from empress jingu ' s sankan-gaisei ( campaign for the three korean kingdoms ) tried to head to nanba and could not go straight , they returned to muko no minato port ( kobe port ) to do some fortune-telling .
wakahirume no mikoto appeared and there was a divine message , ' i would like to stay in ikuta nagao no kuni . '
thus , unagami no isachi was ordered to enshrine her .
this is today ' s ikuta-jinja shrine .
** wakahirume ' in the shinmei ( name of god ) means goddess of the young and fresh day .
** some say that in kojiki and the nihonshoki , which were possibly created after hotsumatsutae , this topic was dropped entirely , causing confusion .
since then , the same god has been enshrined in two locations , tamatsushima and amano .
tamatsushima-jinja shrine is called the three gods of waka along with sumiyoshi-taisha shrine and kakinomono-okami ( akashi ) .
wakahirume changed her name to shitateruhime after getting married , but according to hotsumatsutae , she was referred to as toshitokujin after ascending to heaven as god .
** however , it is widely accepted that hotsumatsutae is a gisho ( apocryphal book ) created in the edo period .
** obiko no mikoto
** shrines that worship obiko no mikoto
** obiko no mikoto ( year of birth and death unknown ) was a member of the imperial family .
kanji characters for " obiko no mikoto " are 大彦命 or 大毘古命 .
** obiko no mikoto was the first prince of the emperor kogen , and his birth mother was the empress utsushikome no mikoto .
he was a older brother of the emperor kaika and sukunahikowokokoro no mikoto ( or in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) he was called sukunahikotakeikokoro no mikoto , and maternal grandfather of the emperor suinin .
he was one of shido-shogun ( generals dispatched to four circuits ) who mainly pacified hokurikudo .
** descriptions in the mythology
on his way to the battle , obiko met a mysterious girl singing an ominous song , so he returned to report this encounter .
he asked yamatototohimomosohime no mikoto to do divination , and she said that it was an omen of a rebellion by takehaniyasuhiko no mikoto and his wife ata hime .
in fact , the rebellion occurred , but obiko and hikokunibuku slew takehaniyasuhiko while kibitsuhiko no mikoto killed ata hime to suppress the rebellion .
** in addition , according to the " kojiki , " after he pacified hokuriku region , obiko met his son takenuna kawawake , who was another shido-shogun and pacified tokai region , in aizu .
( the name of aizu came from this episode . )

** descendants of obiko no mikoto
obiko no mikoto is believed to be the founder of several clans including abe , nasunokuni no miyatsuko , tsukushinokuni no miyatsuko , kashiwade no omi , sasakiyamagimi , igano kuniomi , koshinokuni no miyatsuko , and naniwa no kishi .
** there is a high possibility that obiko no mikoto is identical to ohobiko , an ancestor of owake no omi and whose name is inscribed on the kinsakumei tekken ( an iron sword with gold-inlaid inscriptions ) that was excavated from the inariyama-kofun tumulus in saitama prefecture .
if the two were the same person , many interpret that owake no omi was the abe or kashiwade clan .
there is another possibility , however , that owake no omi was mibu no kishi ( the same clan as naniwa no kishi ) that was very influential in north musashi province later years .
** heresy of genealogy
obiko was described as the father of mimatsu hime , the empress of sujin ; in the section of suijin in the kojiki , however , there is a description that can be interpreted that suijin was obiko ' s uncle .
based on this description , there is a heretical explanation that questions the genealogy in the kojiki and nihonshoki .
** these facts indicate that obiko lived from the late third century to early fourth century , a period that was one generation after the emperor suijin .
one generation after that , or during the era of emperor suinin , described the rebellion of sahobiko that showed numerous similarities , such as the region of occurrence , with the rebellion of takehaniyasuhiko in which obiko was involved .
** the emperor kogen who is said to be the father of obiko is also believed to be the grandfather or great-grandfather of takenouchi no sukune who was said to be born on the same day as the emperor seimu .
this fact also indicates the high possibility that obiko lived in the era of the emperor suijin .
** obiko ' s daughter mimatsu hime who was the empress of sujin was also described in the kojiki as suijin ' s sister .
the credibility of this part of the genealogy is questionable .
** tatari
** tatari refers to a condition wherein a god , buddha , or a soul of human being causes a calamitous condition for human beings , or a supernatural force that works within that condition .
although a word " noroi " has a similar meaning to tatari , the latter mainly indicates a punishment by shinto and buddhist deities whereas the former mainly originates from human resentment .
** summary
** japanese gods innately haunt people or places .
the word ' tatari ' is said to be a corrupted form of ' tachiari , ' meaning the manifestation of god .
infectious diseases , famine , natural disaster , and other calamities are the manifestation of god , and a theory states that religious services in shrines started in awe of god to quell and seal these disasters and enshrine gods .
** today , it is generally believed that the power of god will punish human beings for their violation of divine will , transgressions , malice , or neglect of religious duties .
when a calamity or epidemic occurred , people recognized tatari through bokusen ( divination ) or takusen ( an oracle ) that revealed which divine spirit was causing the disaster and for what reason .
it was also believed that by correcting the error or transgression , tatari could be quelled .
after the syncretism of shinto and buddhism , people believed that the buddha , who was supposed to give salvation , also caused tatari as other divine spirits of the shinto did .
it was believed that such tatari could also be quelled by enshrining the buddha .
this is just a folk belief or opinion , however ; the original buddhism view had no indication that the buddha would cause any calamity or punishment .
** tatari by vengeful ghost
later , when goryo-shinko ( a folk religious belief of avenging spirits ) developed , ghosts of dead and living human were also considered able to curse and harm people .
human spirits with malevolence or malice causing tatari are called onryo ( vengeful ghost ) .
the famous case is tatari caused by sugawara no michizane ( tenjin ) who died in despair .
it was strongly believed that michizane ' s tatari caused seiryo-den ( an imperial summer palace ) thunderbolt striking incident and the death of the emperor daigo .
court nobles at the time were frightened to death so they enshrined with great care the spirit of michizane in the kitano tenmangu shrine to let the tatari spirit ascend to be a guardian god .
this method to transform a tatari spirit to a guardian god by enshrinement seems to be common practice in japan since the introduction of buddhism .
** another well-known vengeful spirit is taira no masakado , and it is said that cataclysms occurred frequently in the vicinity of his tomb " masakado zuka " and they were believed to be caused by masakado ' s tatari .
masakado was deified by shinkyo , a traveling monk of jishu school , and enshrined in kanda-myojin shrine in 0000 .
there is also a rumor that every time the transfer of masakado ' s kubi-zuka ( burial mound for heads ) in otemachi , chiyoda ward , tokyo was scheduled , an accident occurred .
** various forms of tatari
belief in ' tatari-chi ( place of tatari ) ' found throughout japan can be a reflection of primitive religious concept .
tatari-chi is a particular mountain , woods , or fields that is feared to cause a tatari .
it is believed that if people cut trees or own the land , their family members would die .
in tokai region , such places are called ' kuse-chi ' or ' kuse-yama . '
tatari-chi also has local names such as ' otoroshi-tokoro , ' ' bachi-yama , ' or ' irazu-yama . '
places such as these generally have an ominous legend that they used to be an execution ground , for instance .
there is an interesting opinion that these places are actually ancient sacred places for religious services , but only people ' s fear for divine punishment remained as a tatari tradition without religious beliefs .
** another widespread belief is that tatari are caused by divine trees or spiritual trees .
belief in huge trees survived since ancient times and elderly trees still remain in japan today , and so do tatari folk traditions about elderly trees .
in shinshu region , for instance , there is a tradition of a pine tree that shed blood when it was cut with an ax .
many regions across the country have similar traditions .
** it is also believed that the ' spirits of animals ' cause tatari .
the spirits of cats is feared in particular , as the phrase says , ' killing a cat will torment the family for seven generations . '
** animals that have been believed to cause tatari since ancient times
foxes are worshipped as divine servants in the inari faith , and snakes are the embodiment of god in the miwa-yama faith .
therefore , it is believed that if people do harm to these animals , they will be punished .
** aside from these , the tales of the supernatural , include a cat with nine tails , nekomata ( cat monster ) and ghost cat , suggest the widespread belief of folk tradition that fox and cats have the power to torment people .
many instances of jinx on cats can be found in the western countries as well .
** yamanokami ( god of the mountain )
** history
** summary
** diversion
** the term " yamanokami " refers to :
0 . a general expression referring to any god dwelling in a mountain .
it is also called " yamagami " or " sanjin . "
this definition will be explained in this article .
** 0 . because yamanokami was generally considered to be a female deity , many places were barred to women not to invite any disaster by the jealousy of the goddess .
based on this belief , the term " yamanokami " is used by married men to refer to their wives in order to turn down invitations to drinking parties .
** while actual names of the god vary from region to region , " yamanokami " or " yamagami " is commonly used .
a number of differences exist between mountain folk and low-land agriculturalists in the character of their yamanokami and respective ways of worshiping such god .
in both cases , yamanokami is generally regarded as female , resulting in a humble reference to a man ' s wife .
the archetype of such legend matches that of izanamino mikoto described in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
** agriculturalists believe that the yamanokami descend from the mountain in the spring and enter the rice field , where it becomes the tanokami ( rice field goddess ) , and then it returns to the mountain in the fall .
this phenomenon indicates that the kami involved is conceived of as a single entity sharing both characteristics of yamanokami and tanokami .
japanese people , not limited to agriculturalists , have beliefs that the deceased goes to tokoyo ( the perpetual country ) in the mountain where it becomes an ancestral spirit to watch over the descendants .
it leads to a widely accepted theory that the kami ' s original identity was that of an ancestral spirit .
toshigami ( god of the incoming year ) that visits during the new year ' s season is also identified with yamanokami .
it also relates to the fact that mountains are indispensable sources of water for agriculture , or to the belief of a visitor god ( guest god or marebitogami ) who comes from the distant places and brings fertility .
** the mountain peoples who make their livings by hunting , charcoal burning and forestry generally consider the yamanokami a guardian spirit of the mountain .
they do not share the agriculturalists ' belief that the yamanokami leave and return to the mountain , and they believe that the kami always stay there .
the mountain peoples ' yamanokami is said to bear twelve children each year , representing a kami with strong reproductive capabilities .
it is because that their yamanokami is identified with the ubusunagami ( a tutelary of infants and childbirth ) .
mountain people ' s practices regarding the yamanokami tend to involve strict taboos .
for example , entering the mountain on the day of the kami ' s festival ( generally the day with the number twelve , such as december 00 or january 00 ) is prohibited because the kami count the mountain ' s trees on that day .
it is said that anyone cutting down a tree that day will be pinned under it and die .
** this female deity is also said to be adverse to the pollutions of childbirth and menstruation , and women were not allowed to participate on the festival day .
some say that the yamanokami is an ugly hag , with the result that rituals are performed to flatter the kami by offering her items thought to be even uglier , such as stonefish .
it is unknown why the goddess of the mountain has a connection with stonefish from the sea .
some offerings are called ' yamaokoze ' ( mountain stonefish ) , referring to fishes and seashells .
since the ancient times , matagi hunter group regards dried ' yamaokoze ' as a talisman to carry with them or to worship at home .
there is also a practice that forbids the cutting of y-shaped threes because divine spirits are dwelling in such trees , which become the object of worship .
some say that this practice is based on the fact that a y-shaped tree reminds people of the lower half of the female body .
others say that a y-shaped tree is innately ill-balanced and tends to cause an accident when it is cut down , so this practice is actually a measure of precaution .
** in japanese mythology , oyamatsumi was referred as the yamanokami .
in addition , there are yamanokami relating to the specific mountains , include oyamakui no kami of the mount hiei and mount matsuo , or shirayamahime no kami of the mount hakusan .
** yamanokami in mines
many mines in japan have shrines to worship kanayamahiko or kanayamahime , which are also called yamanokami .
in some cases , ore found in the mine becomes the object to worship .
** present
mainly in tohoku and hokkaido regions , there is a remaining forestry custom in which no one works in the mountain and woods on december 00 ( or on january 00 in some regions ) .
remains of the religious festival can be found on the day when forestry cooperatives hold a festival of worship , a year-end party , or a new-year party .
** today , ' yamanokami ' can be used as a figurative expression in sports referring to a person who shows an extraordinary ability in mountain stages at ekiden or long-distance races .
a recent example is masato imai .
** suijin ( the god of water and rain )
** suijin ( or mizugami ) is the generic term for the gods relating to water ( mainly fresh water ) .
** suijin in japan
water is of crucial importance in agriculture , and the availability and quality of water can spell life or death to farmers in terms of the volume of harvest .
as a result , suijin naturally came to be associated with tanokami ( rice-field gods ) .
most suijin are found enshrined on the dikes of irrigation canals , or alongside paddy fields .
in some cases , suijin may be found enshrined as mikumari no kami ( water distributing god ) at the sources of agricultural waterways , in which cases they may also be associated with yamanokami ( god of the mountain ) .
in addition to their connection with the water used in agriculture , suijin are also found enshrined at sources of water used in everyday life , such as household wells and water-drawing spots .
** kappa ( water imp ) , snakes , and dragons are among those symbolizing suijin .
they are considered to be divine servants or even to be the embodiment of a deity .
** the following deities were described as gods related to water in japanese mythology :
** mizuhanohime
takaokami no kami
amenomikumari , kuninomikumari : the deities of the allocation of running water or the watershed .
amenokuhizamochi , kuninokuhizamochi : the deities of the gourd or irrigation .
yamata no orochi ( big snake with eight heads ) : it was originally the suijin of hikawa river .
** amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi
** amatsu tsumi
** kunitsu tsumi
** current status
** " amatsu tsumi " and " kunitsu tsumi " are concepts of crime in in the shintoism .
these terms occur as a pair in oharae no kotoba ( the great purification incantation ) described in ' norito ' ( incantations ) in fascicle ( book ) 0 of the " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) .
amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi are written in kanji characters as " 天つ罪 " and " 国つ罪 " or " 天津罪 " and " 国津罪 . "
** amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi are important concepts in understanding the view of " crimes " in ancient japan , where religion , politics , and legislation were closely related .
as norinaga motoori and the successors pointed out , however , amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi were crimes that were closely related to religion .
" kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) include descriptions implying that secular crimes also existed in ancient japan .
** if one follows shinobu orikuchi ' s theory , originally amatsu tsumi was written as 雨障 , implied how during the rainy season , farmers stayed indoors and were repentant of their misdeeds .
gradually the characters 天つ罪 came to be used for amatsu tsumi , implying susano no mikoto ' s various misdeeds in takamanohara , the plain of high heaven ( see the section of " iwatogakure " ) in japanese mythology .
in response to this interpretation , eventually kunitsu tsumi came to be perceived as the complementary opposite of amatsu tsumi .
** amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi described in oharae no kotoba include the followings .
note that oharae no kotoba only listed the name of the crimes : there are various theories about what each crime means , especially those of kunitsu tsumi .
** it is said that amatsu tsumi originates in the crimes committed by susanoo no mikoto in takamanohara described in " kojiki " and " nihonshoki . "
because all of these crimes are acts to do harm to the agriculture caused by a man , these crimes are considered to exist since the emergence of communities before the establishment of the nation .
** ahanachi
this is a crime where rice field irrigation is interrupted by breaking down the ridges between rice paddies and flowing the water out of the paddies .
" kojiki " and " nihonshoki " describe that susanoo no mikoto committed this crime against the rice field of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) in takamanohara .
mizoume
this is a crime where irrigation is interrupted by filling in the irrigation ditches to prevent the water from being drawn , described in " kojiki " and " nihonshoki . "
hihanachi
this is a crime where irrigation is interrupted by destroying the irrigation pipe to prevent the water from being drawn , described in " nihonshoki . "
shikimaki
this is a crime where a field is sowed where other people have already sown seeds to hinder the development of crops ( or to usurp the others of the cultivation right , some theory states ) , described in " nihonshoki . "
kushisashi
it is described in " nihonshoki " that susanoo no mikoto committed this crime due to his envy of the rice field of amaterasu omikami in takamanohara .
one theory states that the purpose of this crime is to usurp other people ' s fields by setting up stakes at harvest time .
ikihagi
based on this description , one theory states that this crime violates the sacredness of a divine service ( or the preparation for the service ) ; another theory states , on the other hand , that it only refers to skinning and slaughtering the livestock .
sakahagi
this is a crime where a horse is skinned backward from rear to front , and due to the same origin as ikihagi described in " kojiki " and " nihonshoki , " this is also regarded as the violation against the sacredness of a divine service .
it is also the same as ikihagi that it has another theory stating that it only refers to skinning and slaughtering the livestock .
kusohe
based on this description , one theory states that this crime desecrates the ceremonial place for a divine service with filthy matters like excrements .
** crimes described as kunitsu tsumi include diseases and disasters that are not considered to be " crimes " in today ' s notion , which is a distinctive characteristic of kunitsu tsumi .
it is pointed out that some of kunitsu tsumi were based on the belief in yakushi nyorai ( the healing buddha ) in the emperor tenmu ' s era .
the description of " nihonshoki " proves that the faith in yakushi existed in the era of emperor tenmu .
** ikihadadachi
this is a crime of hurting a living person ' s skin , equivalent to a charge of bodily injury .
shinihadadachi
a direct interpretation states that shinihadadachi is a crime of hurting a dead body ' s skin , equivalent to a charge of vandalizing a corpse .
shirahito
shirahito refers to a disease of pale skin , also called byakurai or shirahatake , and it is said to be a kind of leprosy .
kokumi
kokumi refers to a condition in which a person develops a big lump , on the back , or so-called hunchback .
one theory states that it came from the description of " yakushikyo sutra " as described above .
a charge of raping his own mother
incest with his own mother
a charge of raping his own child
incest with his own child
a charge of raping a mother and its child
having a sexual intercourse with a woman and then with her daughter
a charge of raping a child and its mother
a charge of raping animals
woes by crawling insects
this refers to calamities caused by crawling insects ( such as poisonous snakes , centipedes , and scorpions ) .
in " yakushikyo sutra , " there is a description that ' evil elephants , lions , tigers , wolves , bears , poisonous snakes , scorpions , centipedes , mosquitoes , gnats , or other frightful things ' would be cleared by praying for yakushi nyorai .
one theory states , therefore , that ' crawling insects ' refers to those listed following ' poisonous snakes ' in this description .
woes by takatsu kami
it is regarded as natural disasters such as lightning damage .
another theory , by taking the influence of " yakushikyo sutra " into consideration , states that this refers to disasters by unrighteous divine spirits in a broad sense , as described in the sutra : ' yaksha , rakshasa , bishaja , and other evil fierce gods . '
woes by takatsu tori
" woes by flying birds " is found in norito of otonohogai , and thus it is considered to refer to damages to buildings and other mishaps caused by raptorial birds .
this also has another theory stating that this is based on the description of ' attacks by monstrous birds ' in " yakushikyo sutra . "
kemonotaoshi , a crime of doing majimono
this refers to kodo , a magic ritual to kill house stocks and place a curse on others using the carcasses .
** note that ' azunai no tsumi ' ( a crime of burying priests of two shrines together ) described in the article of february of the first year of sessho ( regent ) of empress jingu in " nihon shoki " can also be included to these crimes .
moreover , " kotai jingu gishikicho " adds kawairi ( die by drowning in a river ) and hiyaki ( burnt by fire to death ) to kunitsu tsumi crimes .
regarding these two cases , " yakushikyo sutra " has a section to describe nine kinds of untimely death , the fourth is to be burned to death and the fifth is to drown , so the relation to the brief in yakushi nyorai can be suggested .
** in oharae no kotoba used by jinja honcho ( association of shinto shrines ) and its subordinate shrines , the names of crimes in amatsu tsumi and kunitsu tsumi have been omitted because kunitsu tsumi include discriminatory expressions .
** azuminoisora
** azuminoisora ( written in kanji as 阿曇磯良 or 安曇磯良 ) is a deity within the religion of shinto .
it is a deity of the sea , and also believed to be the ancestor of the azumi clan .
it is also called isotakera .
** " hachiman gudokun , " the book describing the history of iwashimizu hachimangu shrine , reads ' shikaumi daimyojin called azuminoisora . '
it indicates that azuminoisora was the deity enshrined at shikaumi-jinja shrine ( fukuoka city ) at that time ( today , three deities of watatsumi are enshrined at the shrine ) .
since the establishment of the shrine , the azumi clan has been in charge of religious services .
** in addition , " hachimangu goengi " ( history of hachimangu shrine ) states that isora is the same deity as amenokoyane no mikoto that is enshrined at kasuga taisha shrine .
** in " taiheiki " ( the record of the great peace ) , the appearance of isora ( adobe no isora ) is described as follows :
the empress jingu invited deities to send the army to the three kingdoms of korea , but only adobe no isora who lived at the bottom of the sea did not appear because he was ashamed of his ugly face with oysters and abalones .
sumiyoshi sanjin ( sumiyoshi three deities ) made the stage in the sea and performed isora ' s favorite dance to entice him to come out , and he accepted .
thanks to these magical jewels , the empress succeeded in conquering the three korean kingdoms .
the mekari-jinja shrine that faces the kanmon straits in kitakyushu city was said to have been established to pacify isora ' s nigimitama and aramitama at hayato on the way home from the conquer of three korean kingdoms .
** azuminoisora is also called azuminoisoramaru , the name said to be the origin of naming ships with a suffix " maru " ( but there are various opinions ) .
" achime " in " achimenowaza , " one of kagura ( music and dancing performed at shrine ) that has been handed down at the court , refers to azumi or adobe .
** gohei
** an expression relating to gohei
** gohei is one type of heihaku used in the religious services of shinto , made by clipping two shide ( zigzag strips of paper ) into a heigushi ( staff ) made of bamboo or other wood .
also called heisoku or nusa .
** while usual shide strips are made from white paper , those to be clipped into to gohei can be five-color paper , gold foil or silver foil in addition to white paper .
** originally , offerings of fuhaku ( cotton , silk , textile fabrics ) were presented to the god by clipping them into a wood staff , and this practice forms the origin for today ' s customary gohei .
** a gohei with several heisoku stripes attached to a long wood or bamboo stick is specifically called bonten .
** gohei wo katsugu : be superstitious and bothered with superstitions .
** shitateruhime
** summary
** parents
** summary
** shrines
** archetype of shitateruhime
** heresy and popular myth
** shitateruhime is a deity in shinto described in japanese mythology .
** shitateruhime is described in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
she is also described in apocryphal books such as " sendai kujihongi " ( ancient japanese history ) and " hotsumatsutae . "
** name
** in " kojiki , " takahime no mikoto is also called shitateruhime no mikoto .
** in " nihonshoki , " her name is shitateruhime .
she is also called takahime and wakakunitama .
** in " sendai kujihongi " ( lineage of the mononobe and soga clans ) , she is called shitateruhime no mikoto .
** in " hotsumatsutae , " her name is shitateruhime .
** in " kojiki , " shitateruhime is a daughter of okuninushi and takiribime no mikoto , and a younger sister of ajisukitakahikone no kami .
** in " nihonshoki , " she is a daughter of utsushikunitama .
** in " sendai kujihongi : lineage of the mononobe and soga , " she is a daughter of onamuchi no kami and tagorihime no kami , and a younger sister of ajisukitakahikone no kami .
** " hotsumatsutae " describes hiruko ( hiruko hime ) , the first-born daughter of takahito and isako , as having named herself shitateruhime after she married as a sister deity of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) .
** in the genealogy of okuninushi no kami described in " kojiki , " shitateruhime is indicated as a younger sister of ajisukitakahikone .
that is why takahime is known as another name of shitateruhime , but some regard these as the names of sisters .
in " sendai kujihongi : lineage of the mononobe and soga , " onamuchi no kami and takatsu hime no kami have a daughter named takateruhime no omikami no mikoto , who is a younger sister of tsumihayae kotoshironushi .
this description can be a source of confusion .
** according to the " kojiki " and the main text of " nihonshoki , " shitateruhime married amenowakahiko who was sent from takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to pacify ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the central land of reed plains ) .
when amenowakahiko was killed by an arrow flung back from takamanohara , shitateruhime ' s wailing voice reached the heaven ( or takamanohara in " kojiki " ) .
hearing her voice , amenowakahiko ' s father , amatsukunitama no kami , descended to ashihara no nakatsukuni and built a mourning hut to hold a funeral .
when ajisukitakahikone , whose appearance so closely resembled that of amenowakahiko , visited the funeral , amatsukunitama no kami mistook him for his own son returned from the dead and rejoiced .
angered that he had been taken for a polluted dead person , ajisukitakahikone stomped down the mourning hut with his feet and flew off .
shitateruhime wrote a poem that revealed the name of ajisukitakahikone .
this poem is called ' hinaburi ' ( " rustic song " ) .
( the main text of " nihon shoki " contains no description that she made such hinaburi . )
in an " alternate writing " in the first section of " nihonshoki , " the name of amenowakahiko ' s wife is not indicated .
the name of shitateruhime appears as the person who wrote the hinaburi and as a sister of ajisukitakahikone .
** onamochimiko no tamae no kami no yashiro shrine ( also called otomi no yashiro . a related shrine outside the precincts of izumo taisha shrine ) : main enshrined deity shitateruhime no mikoto
** himekoso-jinja shrine ( nanba higashi-obase , higashinari ward , osaka city ) : main enshrined deity : shitateruhime no mikoto ( up to the edo period , it was gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) )
" engishiki jinmyocho " ( a register of shrines in japan ) indicates that shitateruhime no yashiro is himekoso-jinja shrine .
note that the main enshrined deity of himekoso no yashiro was changed from gozu tenno to shitateruhime no mikoto after the meiji period .
** mefu-jinja shrine ( takarazuka city ) : main enshrined deity shitateruhime no kami
shitori-jinja shrine ( tottori prefecture )
although the current main enshrined deity is takehatsuchi no mikoto , the history of the shrine includes many references of shitateruhime .
therefore , up to the taisho period , it was believed that shitateruhime was the main enshrined deity of this shrine .
a mound in the precinct of shitori-jinja shrine had been believed to be the grave of shitateruhime , but excavation discovered that it was a kyozuka ( mound of buddhist scriptures ) .
** there is a theory stating that the kojiki and the nihonshoki used himiko as the archetype of amaterasu in heaven and shitateru hime on earth .
in this sense , shitateruhime can be interpreted as a portrait of himiko that captured a more realistic image .
** it is highly possible that her brother ajisukitakahikone is the same deity as kotoshironushi , hitokotonushi , omononushi , and oyamakui no kami , based on the legends of shrines across the country .
based on the combination with ajisukitakahikone or the fatter okuninushi and the mother takiribime , some regard that ichikishimahime ( syncretized with munakata sanjojin and benzaiten ) , mitsuhanohime , and ameshirukarumizuhi are the same deity as shitateruhime with different names .
** in " honmatsutae , " she is referred to as wakahime , the goddess of waka ( japanese poem ) , or called wakahirume as a sister of amaterasu omikami .
it is described that , to ogurahime , a daughter of amakunitama , she entrusted a document entitled the kumokushi-fumi , containing the inner mysteries of waka songs , as well as honoring her with her own name of shitateruhime .
later , after her death , wakahime was revered under the posthumous name of the deity toshinori kami .
** chinju no mori ( sacred shrine forest )
** meaning
** man-made cases
** vegetation
** decline
** chinju no mori " are forests attached to shinto shrines , managed and maintained so as to enclose the sando ( approach to the temple ) and the haisho ( place of prayer ) .
** since every shrine used to be surrounded by a chinju no mori , it is often written with a character meaning ' a god ' s forest , ' as opposed to the normal character for forest .
there are also examples of the characters for ' shrine ' ( usually pronounced ' jinja ' ) being read as ' mori ' ( forest ) , which reflects that shrine shinto derives from koshinto .
** if you look at a shrine from a distance , there is usually a thick forest with a torii gate at one end .
this clearly shows that ' yashiro ' ( shrines ) did not come first , but were built in forests that were already worshiped .
in cases where there is a long-protected forest near the coast , known as an uotsuki rin ( literally ' fish-attracting woods ' ) , there usually is a shrine .
** just like koshinto , there are some shrines even today , such as omiwa-jinja shrine , which enshrines mt . miwa in nara prefecture , that regard mountains themselves as the kami ' s shintai or yorishiro ( an object capable of attracting kami ) .
some shrines don ' t even have a honden or haiden , the shintai being a forest or the hill it stands on ; these shrines have passed down koshinto , an indigenous religion which worships nature and the dead .
** according to akira miyawaki , ' chinju no mori ' is used as a academic term by the international association for vegetation science .
** on the other hand , there are some cases of chinju no mori being made for a shrine .
meiji-jingu shrine is especially famous .
** chinju no mori are considered to have been preserved as they were in ancient times .
consequently , the forest is thought to preserve the original vegetation , the so-called potential natural vegetation , of the area .
since the surrounding natural environment is usually destroyed today , chinju no mori are often one of the few keys to knowing what the natural state of the area used to be like .
in that sense , chinju no mori are important for japanese silviculture , where they are known as jinjarin ( shrine forest ) or shajirin ( temple forest ) and are often surveyed .
in the process , if their value is confirmed , many of them gain protection as natural monuments .
the forests attached to utaki ( sacred places ) in okinawa are similar in that sense .
** however , it is better not to think that all of the forest is old vegetation .
when the surrounding area is developed and the chinju no mori is left isolated , the vegetation , which originally covered a wide area is cut back .
as a result , the area becomes smaller , which makes it highly likely that some species will disappear .
although some species may continue to grow along side streams , these areas are not included in chinju no mori and so large parts of the forest , having existed for centuries , are lost .
at the same time , aridification also often occurs .
as a result , some parts change and new species move in .
for example , it is believed that the camphor tree commonly seen in shrines did not originally grow in forests in southern central japan .
also , deciduous trees such as the keyaki ( a type of elm ) and the muku tree are not supposed to commonly grow in the mature forests located to the south of the flatlands in central honshu ( the main island of japan ) .
** since most plants need a specific animal for pollinating and seed dispersal , such declines in the animal community can affect the vegetation itself in various ways .
** the forests are also affected directly by people .
non-wild plants are often planted in the precincts of shrines .
when a tree falls , trees such as sugi ( japanese cedars ) or cypresses is often planted to fill the space ( the technical term is " gap " ) left behind .
it has been reported that the utilization of forest resources in the precincts of shrines has been increasing in recent times .
in recent years , maintenance such as weeding and raking of fallen leaves has been carried out in some forests but , when done in a natural forest as opposed to forests maintained for wood fuel or planted forests , this promotes degradation .
in other cases , forests are sometimes cut down around their circumference , or the edges are trimmed to make way for road expansion .
in such cases , the floor of forests that have lost their mantle or fringe vegetation tends to dry out , making them prone to degradation .
what is more , there is increasing use of repair methods , such as spraying concrete , which are simple but leave no chance for natural recovery .
** therefore , they are readily reduced in size when improving roads , and are sometimes reduced to make way for public facilities such as nursery schools .
furthermore , in big cities , some forests have been completely lost .
there are shrines consisting of only a torii gate and a honden , with the meaning of the shrine as an addition to the original nature worship already lost .
** in the past , before the meiji period , there used to be shrines of varying size in each settlement , each surrounded by a chinju no mori .
their number was reduced significantly following what is known as the shrine merger order .
this resulted in many shrines being abolished , and at the same time , their chinju no mori being cut down .
kumagusu minakata opposed the shrine mergers , fearing that this deforestation would cause large-scale destruction of the natural environment .
** there is a theory that the objective of the mergers was actually the acquisition of rights to the lumber and its by-products ( such as camphor ) .
shrines located to the south of the central honshu in particular had lots of big trees , including camphor and tabu ( machilus thunbergii ) trees , which were said to fetch large sums of money .
** on a smaller scale , sacred trees in shrines often had large samurai orchids ( neofinetia falcata ) or sekkoku orchids ( dendrobium moniliforme ) growing on them , but they are hardly seen these days due to the influence of the wildflower boom .
there seems to have been a similar case in the past , when kumagusu minakata found large , imposing epiphytic orchids at a shrine in wakayama prefecture and delightedly told the shinto priest .
however , the priest gave it a lot of publicity , angering kumagusu , who wrote , ' it is terrible to publicize such an exceptional thing like that . it will end up stolen . '
** kunitama ( the spirit of the land )
** kunitama is a concept of shintoism , referring to the sanctification or spiritualization of a province ( an administrative division in feudal japan ) or the land itself .
in kanji , ' kunitama ' can be written as 国魂 or 国霊 .
** norinaga motoori wrote , ' those virtuous kami ( deities , spirits ) who care for ( literally , " complete " ) the land are called kunitama or kunimitama . '
in ancient times it was considered that the rule of each province was not the task of statesmen alone ; it could only be accomplished through the power of the unseen kami enshrined in each area or district .
** the kami okuninushi is also known as okunitama no kami or utsushi kunitama no kami , though it is believed this is because the kunitama no kami from each province were combined into okuninushi .
okuninushi , worshiped as the kami of land reclamation in each provincial shrine , is considered to have originally been the kunitama no kami of the province .
in izumo no kuni fudoki ( records of the culture and geography of izumo province ) , however , there is a story that okunitama no kami and not kunitama no kami descended to iinashi-go , ou-no-kori ( present yasugi city , shimane prefecture ) .
in the records , okunitama no mikoto , amenoshitatukurashi okami ( okuninushi ) , and onamochi ( another name of okuninushi ) are described as separate kami .
** shrines that have ' kunitama ' in their name or enshrine kami who have ' kunitama ' in their names are as follows :
** in many shrines on reclaimed land , such as hokkaido jingu , okunitama no kami is enshrined as one of the three kami of land reclamation , along with onamuji no kami ( okuninushi no kami ) and sukunabikona no kami .
** tsubaki grand shrine of america in washington state enshrines ' america-kokudokunimitama-no-o-kami ' ( protector of north america ) .

this spell , however , may bring misfortune .
according to a dictionary published in the edo period , " genen , " remembering the spell on the new year ' s eve is ominous .
** the relationship between kanbari nyudo and little cuckoo is said to be originated in the fact that one of the kanji characters for the bird 郭公 ( kakko ) has a similar sound to 郭登 ( kakuto ) which represents a chinese deity for toilet .
** " kasshibyawa " written by kiyoshi matsuura contains a tale that , when a person called the name of kanbari nyudo in the toilet , the head of nyudo appeared .

** binbo-gami
** summary
** binbo-gami is a god who brings poverty to the people whom they cling to or their families .
the name appears in folklores , essays , rakugo ( traditional comic storytelling ) , etc . in various areas of japan .

it is believed that no matter what the appearance , it always likes lazy people .
when it possesses a home , it prefers to live in the closet .
** in " toenkai , " a collection of strange stories from the edo period by bakin kyokutei , etc . , there is a story described below titled kyuki .
in 0000 , there was a home in bancho , edo where misfortune continued .
a man serving the samurai family visited soka one day , and became acquainted with a monk .
when the man asked the monk where he came from , he explained that he was at the house where the man served until now .
when the man told the monk that he had never seen him at the house , the monk laughed and said the following before disappearing .
people are becoming ill one after the other in that house , and it is all the work of me , the binbo-gami . '
that house has reached extreme poverty , so i am moving to another house . '
your master ' s fortune will improve from now on . '
as he said , the fortune of the house in which the man served gradually improved .
** since it is a god in a fashion , it cannot be brought down , but ways to drive them away do exist .
in niigata prefecture , it is believed that binbo-gami go away due to the heat when a fire is built in the irori fireplace ( open hearth ) on new year ' s eve , and instead , the god of good fortune arrive , delighted by the warmth .
there are many popular beliefs on the binbo-gami and irori , and in tsushima-cho , kitauwa-gun , ehime prefecture ( the present uwajima city ) , it is believed that digging the fire in the irori too much brings out the binbo-gami .
** the following is a story from the essay " tankai " by soan tsumura .
long ago , when a man was taking a nap at home , he dreamed of an old man in ragged clothing entering the zashiki ( japanese style tatami room ) , and since then , nothing went well .
four years later , the old man appeared in his dream and told him he will leave the house .
additionally , as a way to not invite binbo-gami in the future , he taught as follows ;
never cook yakimiso , since binbo-gami likes miso . '
eating raw miso is even worse , and if it is eaten , you will not be able to start the fire to grill miso . '
once these were followed , the house was never in distress again .
** in connection to the theory that binbo-gami likes yakimiso , in senba , osaka , there was an event for sending off the binbo-gami until around 0000 .
at the end of every month , miso was grilled at a merchant ' s home in senba , and it was shaped into a plate and carried around homes by the clerk , filling the air with aromatic scents .
after some time , the yakimiso is broken in two .
by doing so , the binbo-gami , who came out of the house , lured by the scent of his favorite yakimiso , was believed to be trapped in the yakimiso .
the banto would release the yakimiso in the river , and would thoroughly wash away the scent of miso on himself before returning , so that he would not invite the binbo-gami .
additionally , according to the poet , mitsuyuki nakamura , binbo-gami has an uchiwa in his hand to fan and enjoy the scent of this miso .
** some say that if the people of the house it possessed treat it kindly , it transforms into a god of good fortune .
his prayers were somewhat answered .
this binbo-gami was considered the god who changes poverty into good fortune , and there is a hokora ( a small shrine ) enshrined today at the side of ushi-tenjin shrine in kitano-jinja shrine in kasuga , bunkyo ward , tokyo .
by first praying to invite the binbo-gami into the house , and then worshipping it carefully on the 00st day which is the completion day of a vow to send it off , the connection with the binbo-gami can be cut .
** faith
** there is a binbogami-jinja shrine built in ida city , nagano prefecture , and the wooden statue of binbo-gami placed there is enshrined not for worship , but for punching and kicking .

** similar trials by ordeal were also held in europe .
** in the entry for september , 000 , it is recorded that as the social order broke down , some people lost their old kabane ( hereditary title ) or intentionally adopted uji ( family names ) of higher ranks .
in order to amend the situation , a kugatachi was held at amakashi no oka hill .
after bathing for purification , each person tied up the sleeves of their kimonos and underwent kugatachi .
because people with the right kabane didn ' t get scalded but all people with false kabane did , those who were lying and hadn ' t had their turn yet were too afraid to go forward .
therefore it was immediately known who was innocent and who was guilty .
a note on the entry records that the specific procedure is to ' put mud into an iron pot and boil it , then put your hand into the pot and search the mud . '
** in the entry for september , 000 , it is recorded that lawsuits between people from mimana ( on the korean peninsula ) and japan that could not be decided were settled by kugatachi .
** there are no records about kugatachi for the next 000 years .
it is unknown if trials by kugatachi were not held or were continuously held in secret during this period .
** however they reappear in records during the oei era in the muromachi period .
during this period , the practice was known as yugisho ( testimony by boiling water ) .
in particular , shogun yoshimasa ashikaga often used kugatachi for political trials .
but they disappeared from the records again after that .
** it was completely without scientific and rational basis but , for people in earlier times , it was effective to some extent , instilling fear in suspects and making them confess their crimes .
** after the end of the use of kugatachi as a trial by ordeal , the term came to signify the hot water used to purify the body when worshipping before the gods .
shinto rituals such as yudate ( a rite where water boiled in an iron pot is applied to worshipers using bamboo leaves ) and yugisho ( testimony by boiling water ) originated from this sense of kugatachi .
** sanbo ( shinto )
** a sanbo , also known as a sanpo , is a small stand used in shinto rituals for presenting shinsen ( offerings of food and alcohol ) to kami ( deities , spirits ) .
in ancient times , it was also used when presenting things to members of the upper-classes .
similar items are used at buddhist temples as well , and the term is sometimes written with the chinese characters 三宝 ( sanpo ) , which also represent the triratna , or three treasures of buddhism : buddha , dharma ( teachings ) , and sangha ( community ) .
** a sanbo is usually made of unfinished wood such as japanese cypress , and consists of a tray called an oshiki on top of a cuboid-shaped base ( body ) .
the name ' sanbo ' ( literally ' three sides ' ) comes from the fact that there are holes on three sides of the base .
the tray and the base used to be separate , with the tray put on the base before use and sometimes even used by itself without the base .
these days , the tray is always attached to the base , and a separate tray is available for use aside from the sanbo .
** the seam made when the ends of the board that forms the lip of the tray meet should be on the opposite side from the side without a hole .
when it is offered to a kami , the side without a hole ( the side opposite the seam ) should face toward the kami .
when holding a sanbo with offerings on it , people should place their thumbs on the side edges , support the tray and the base with the other fingers , and keep the sanbo at eye level .
** kinomata no kami
** main shrines where kinomata no kami is enshrined
** yakami hime was the first wife of onamuji no kami .
when onamuji no kami took suseribime as his legal wife , however , yakami hime was so afraid of suseribime that she returned to her parental home , leaving her baby at a fork in a tree .
that is why the baby was named kinomata no kami .
another name for this kami is mii no kami ( 御井神 ) .
although the gender of this kami is not known according to the " kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) , many shrines describe this kami as an eldest son of onamuji no kami in their biography .
kinomata no kami is generally worshipped as kami of tree , kami of water and kami of a safe birth .

** altar
** types of altars
** altars in shinto
** altars in christianity
** altars in buddhism
** an altar is a structure for making sacrifices and offerings to gods , spirits , and death .
the style and size of altars varies from religion to religion , with the biggest one being the temple of heaven in china , made to enshrine heaven .
** early altars consisted of natural objects or man-made items and later , with the construction of shrines , became more structurally complicated .
as altar construction became more complicated , various materials , such as marble or metal , were used and elaborate decorations were sometimes added .
** it is said that the origin of shinto altars was the toshidana , a shelf set up specially for rituals such as new year , and they became permanent structures from the middle ages onwards .
when enshrining an image of a deity , a hokora ( a small shrine ) is built , with the image covered by a roof or placed in a zushi ( a small sacred cabinet with a double-leaf door ) or a mikoshi ( a portable shrine ) .
shinto altars are divided into two types : an iwasaka , encircled by piled-up stones and enshrining a deity ; and a himorogi , a sacred place planted with evergreen trees and enshrining an object of worship .
sometimes there is no physical structure but it is still called an altar .
** in addition , when enshrining the dead , a soreisha ( a small shrine dedicated to family ancestral spirits ) is prepared separately from the kamidama ( a household shinto altar ) .
** in christianity , altar commonly refers to the table where mass is held in a church .
altars have represented the body of jesus christ or the dining table of ' the last supper ' since ancient times .
** although altars were designated to be built of stone , in fact wood and metal were also used .
an antependium hung on the front is used as decoration , and some altars have decorations applied directly to their front .
some elaborately decorated altars , such as that in the basilica of sant ' ambrogio in milan , have gold and silver reliefs on the side as well as the front .
besides that , some altars have a retable on the top of the altar , and a reredos behind the altar .
** the altar in the inner sanctum of eastern orthodox churches are referred to as the holy table .
** in a broad sense , the daidan ( great altar ) and the gomadan ( an altar used in homa fire rituals ) used in the esoteric buddhism are also regarded as altars .
** yorishiro
** summary
** from ancient shinto to shrine shinto
** human yorishiro , kannagi
** tsukumogami and mounds - consoling the spirits of the dead and thanksgiving
** the term " yorishiro " refers to an object that divine spirits are drawn or summoned to , and it denotes a shintai ( an object believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) or sometimes a shrine precincts .
** meaning
in that sense , all things in nature can be yorishiro , and it is said they originated in the worship of iwakura ( large rocks where kami dwell ) and himorogi ( a temporarily erected sacred space or " altar " used as the locus of worship ) .
** the yorishiro for the sun god ( also called ohisama or nichirin ) are the sun ( hi ) and a mirror , which is a symbol of the sun .
** vocabulary
yorishiro are called okishiro by the people who welcome the spirits .
** the term " yorishiro " is a fairly new word .
** the term yorishiro was needed because there were no words to denote what was called " kami-oroshi " ( possession by a kami , " god " ) of various objects in ancient shinto and japanese folk beliefs .
** on special occasions such as festivals , yorishiro can be moved from mountains and shrines so that people can be closer to the divine spirits .
for example , mikoshi ( portable shrines carried in a festival ) and dashi ( festival floats ) are familiar to ordinary people .
** many of the major gods enshrined at yashiro can be traced back to the ancient shinto and appear in japanese myths in human form , with a number of such gods enshrined at a single shrine .
** kannagi , written with the chinese character " 巫 " , can also be written " 神和ぎ " , which literally means ' appeasing the god ' , and when a human being is a yorishiro , the term ' yorimashi ' is used .
this term ' s history is even longer than that of ' yorishiro ' , and a book named " shochusho " , written at the end of the heian period , mentions ' call a possessed person yorimashi ' .
** yorimashi can be written with the chinese characters for ' corpse ' and ' child ' and , as such , often implies a child .
in addition , kannagi can be either female or male , and even today there are a few cases of men or children being yorimashi , although most have been shrine maidens .
the origins of shinto priests and shrine maidens lie in the fact that yorimashi became yorimashi and professional oracles delivered divine will or divine messages from yorishiro to ordinary people .
they had a shamanistic element , and himiko ( a legendary queen of yamatai , an ancient country in japan ) was said to be a shrine maiden who worked as a shaman .
in addition , practitioners of onmyodo ( a form of divination ) , while influenced by taoism , yin and yang , and the five elements of chinese cosmology , are classified as shinto and can function as yorishiro and conduits for prayer .
** the term " tsukumogami " refers to long-lived creatures and long-used tools which , possessed by a soul or a god , become yorishiro .
it is believed they bring happiness when they are in comfort but bring trouble if they get angry ; they are often also called yokai ( supernatural beings ) .
tools which can become tsukumogami cover everything people need in their everyday life such as umbrellas , inkstones and wells , and some creatures such as foxes , cats and weasels are also thought to be able to become tsukumogami .
refer to tsukumogami for further details .
** shinme
** shinme ( or jinme , sacred horse ) is a term used to refer to a horse that is dedicated to a japanese shrine or one used in rites and festivals .
there is no rule about the kinds of horses to be chosen , and they are believed to be ridden by god ( deities , spirits ) .
** since the nara period , it has been customary to dedicate horses as a prayer to god .
dedicators range from ordinary people to members of the imperial family .
** since caring for horses can be a burden for small shrines and horses are expensive for dedicators , they were gradually replaced by ' ema ' ( wooden votive plaques , originally with a picture of a horse ) .
in many cases , a life-size statue of horse is regarded as a shinme .
** occasionally , when many horses are used at festivals and other events , they are temporarily called shinme .
** shrines that keep shinme
ise-jingu shrine
tado-taisha shrine
sumiyoshi-taisha shrine
usa-jingu shrine
nikko tosho-gu shrine
kamigamo-jinja shrine
iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine
kotohira-gu shrine
omuroasama-jinja shrine
** hakushu
** ｅtiｑuette
** types
** origin
** the term " hakushu " or " kashiwade " ( both of which mean clapping ) refers to a gesture people make when they offer prayers to gods ( deities , spirits ) at shinto religious services or before shinto shrines or household altars .
hakushu is written with the chinese characters for ' beat ' and ' hand ' ( 拍手 ) or ' oak hand ' ( 柏手 ) and it is also known as " hirate " ( 開手 - ' open hand ' ) .
** join your palms , and after spreading your hands to the sides , join them again .
generally , clap your hands when rejoining your palms to make a sound .
since the purpose of making clapping sounds is to express gratitude or joy , the etiquette is different at solemn events and when expressing sorrows ( see below ) .
it is also said that the clapping sounds are made to invoke gods to make your wish come true or to ward off evil spirits .
in this sense , making silent hakushu can be construed as avoiding warding off spirits of the dead .
** there are several types of hakushu .
four or more hand claps , such as those used at izumo-taisha shrine ( four claps ) , usa-jingu shrine ( four claps ) and ise-jingu shrine ( eight claps ) are known as ' nagate ' ( long claps ) .
there is another type called ' yahirate ' , which is eight claps followed by a final short one .
among other types are ' shinobite ' ( soundless clapping ) , in which hands are clapped silently at shinto funerals , and ' raishu ' , one clap made when receiving a cup of sake at naorai ( banquets held at the end of festivals ) .
** more specific examples of hakushu etiquette include occasions when the palms are joined exactly so that the tips of the fingers ( including the thumb ) meet the tips of the same fingers of the other hand and occasions when the palms are intentionally not joined so exactly .
the latter case is further divided between times when the palms are joined exactly at first and then slid half way through ; and another time when the palms are not precisely joined from beginning to end .
** for a clearer sound , claps are made such that the tips of the fingers of the right hand go between the fingers of the left hand .
** this shows that hakushu were made toward both gods and nobles in ancient times but the custom of hakushu toward humans gradually died out , leaving only the practice of hakushu toward gods .
** according to a popular theory , the name ' kashiwade ' comes from mistaking ' 拍 ' ( pronounced as ' haku ' ) for ' 柏 ' ( pronounced as ' haku ' or ' kashiwa ' ) or from confusion between the two similar characters .
another theory relates it to ' kashiwade ' , which means a court cook .
there is still another theory that the shape of the joined hands was likened to an oak ( " kashiwa " in japanese ) leaf .
** saijin
** saijin is a shinto term that signifies a deity enshrined in a shinto shrine .
** history
today , many shrines have gods from japanese mythology as their saijin or share the same gods as those of japanese mythology .
** likewise , saijin became anthropomorphic deities with names derived from gods and goddesses of japanese mythology or with names ending with ' mikoto , ' ' hiko ' or ' hime ' instead of having just place names or shrine names .
also , it became common that shinto shrines prayed for the coming of powerful gods from inari-jinja shrine or hachiman-gu shrine to be their shushin ( shushin ) .
** shushin , haishin
generally more than one saijin are enshrined in a shrine .
** haishin usually have some connection to the shushin but sometimes they were enshrined together for obscure reasons .
some haishin were enshrined concurrently with shushin , and some were added later .
this type includes deities who were originally haishin and later became shushin .
when shrines were forced to merge in the meiji period , some shrines came to enshrine many haishin .
** aidono ( 相殿 , also written as 合殿 ) is a building in a shinto shrine which enshrines several deities , including the shushin .
deities enshrined in the aidono are referred to as ' aidonoshin . '
if the shrine enshrines both shushin and haishin , haishin are called aidonoshin .
** taimatsu torch
** torches in shinto rituals
** torches for juggling
** torches as symbols
** torches in catholicism
** blowtorch
** taimatsu is the japanese word for torch , a lighted piece of wood which can be held and used as a light source and for illumination .
generally , it is a long stick or pole with a piece of cloth soaked in flammable substance ( such as pine resin ) wrapped around its tip .
** if a mixture of sulfur and lime is used , the torch will remain lit under water .
such torches were used in ancient rome .
** many religious services and fire festivals around the world use torches to light up the night sky or to carry a sacred flame .
in summer in japan , there used to be an event called ' mushioi ' or ' mushiokuri ' in which people used torches to burn harmful insects flying over the fields .
this later evolved from agricultural practice into fire festivals , some of which are held to ask for a good harvest , for protection against fires , or for protection against insects .
** torches are also used as illumination at night or to carry a sacred flame in shinto rituals such as festivals .
other rituals that use fire include the " okuribi " bonfire held on the last night of the bon festival and the " toronagashi " ceremony where paper lanterns are floated down a river .
torches used for rituals held at night or for those dedicated to gods and the dead can be seen not only in japan but also all over the world including asia , ancient europe , greece , and rome .
** the torch and the relay were introduced at the 0000 berlin olympic games .
** juggling torch is used as a toss juggling tool .
while juggling , the torch is repeatedly tossed up and caught .
it is performed in the same way as knife or club juggling , but the sound and residual image of the fire creates a strong impression on the audience .
since using fire is dangerous , it is difficult for unskilled jugglers to do this kind of juggling .
even skilled jugglers need to be very careful , though it is unlikely that such a skilled juggler burns himself .
** the torch is a common symbol of ' lighting up the darkness ' or ' enlightening the world . '
for example , the official name of the statue of liberty , which holds a torch in its right hand , is ' liberty enlightening the world . '
downward-pointing crossed torches were a common sign of mourning in ancient greece and rome .
downward-pointing torches symbolized death , while upward-pointing torches represented the regenerative power of flame and symbolized life .
** the torch as a light in the darkness is also used as a symbol of political organizations and parties .
the logo of britain ' s conservative party features a hand holding a torch .
likewise , until 0000 , the mark of britain ' s labour party featured a torch crossed with a spade , representing a farmer .
the national flag of the republic of congo ( former zaire ) also has a hand holding a torch in the center , representing revolution and freedom .
** throughout its long history , the catholic church has had a tradition of not easily giving up something once it has been used for a mass or ceremony .
although torches were originally only used for providing illumination during mass , their role grew in importance and they eventually became an essential part of solemn mass .
** today , however , even in solemn mass held at the vatican , they use a tall candle in a self-standing candleholder rather than a torch .
these are carried by torchbearers , brought to the altar when sanctus is sung , and taken away after holy communion .
** anglican high churches and some lutheran churches use torches in their services .
** the word ' torch ' when used on construction sites refers to the small handheld oxyacetylene or propane burner , used to cut or weld metals such as iron .
** hono
** therefore , the offerings used in hono are not always ' materials ' such as food , liquor , money or valuable items .
rather , in general , ' activities ' such as kagura ( sacred music and dancing performed at shrines ) , yokyoku ( noh song ) , dance , martial arts or parades with dashi ( floats ) or mikoshi ( portable shrine ) are offered in many cases .
the ancient customs of sacrifice and ' hitobashira ' ( the practice of burying people alive under pillars of buildings to ensure protection ) , although cruel , could also be regarded as a form of hono .
** tablets such as ema ( wooden plaques on which people write their prayers and wishes ) or sangaku ( wooden plaques containing geometrical puzzles ) are also occasionally offered as hono .
** otabisho
** otabisho means the place where a deity ( usually the mikoshi , or portable shrine , that carries the deity ) takes a rest or stays overnight while on a ritual procession during a shrine festival ( shinko-sai festival ) .
it can also mean the destination of such processions .
there are sometimes several otabisho set up along the tour route .
on the arrival of the mikoshi at the otabisho , the otabisho-sai ceremony is performed .
** otabisho are selected from among places related to the shrines or the enshrined deity , or places important to the shrine ' s parish district .
some otabisho , such as motomiya ( original shrines ) , auxiliary and branch shrines , and shrines dedicated to ' consort deities , ' have actual shrine buildings .
in other cases , temporary structures set up on previously enshrined land or the house of the head ( tonin ) of the parishioners ( ujiko ) also serve as otabisho .
** iwakamutsukari no mikoto
** iwakamutsukari no mikoto , who appears in the japanese mythology , is a courtier of emperor keiko .
he is worshiped as ' soshin ( an ancestor worshiped as a deity ) for cooking . '
** he is said to be a grandson of obiko no mikoto .
the emperor praised his cooking skills and gave iwakamutsukari no mikoto the title of kashiwade no otomobe ; his descendants , the takahashi clan , and inherited the post of daizenshiki ( office of the palace table ) at court for generations .
** in shoin ( a section in charge of primitive soy sauce ) of daizenshiki at court , iwakamutsukari no mikoto was worshiped as ' takabe no kami , ' the god of brewing and seasoning .
** reisai ( regular festival )
** reisai is a term used to to describe one kind of saishi , religious services that are performed annually at shinto shrines .
** among saishi , reisai is regarded as the most important .
** reisai is held once a year , and in many cases on a day specially associated with the enshrined deity or the shrine .
for example , in shrines dedicated to human gods , it is often performed on the birthday or the death day of the sacred person .
if there is no such commemorative day , a spring festival or an autumn festival is regarded as reisai .
reisai is held on a given date every year and no one is allowed to change the date in vain .
even after world war ii , shrines administered by jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) need to require approval from the jinja-honcho to change the date of reisai .
** history
it is only in recent times that the name ' reisai ' has come into use .
before then , it was known as ' oomatsuri ' , ' onmatsuri ' or the host shrine ' s name with the suffix meaning a festival , such as ' kasuga-matsuri ' festival or ' iwashimizu-sai ' festival , was used .
in recent times , the phrase ' the xxxx shrine reisai , xxth day of xxxx ' can be found on posters for noted places in various regions .
this indicates that the custom of using ' reisei ' to describe a shrine ' s most important festival is firmly established .
** the system of heihaku presentation by the state was abolished after world war ii .
however , imperial envoys ( chokushi ) still attend reisai at shrines designated as chokusai-sha ( shrine attended by imperial envoy ) .
for other shrines , the official heihaku presentation system was replaced with " honcho-hei ' offerings from jinja-honcho . ( however , this is true only of shrines administered by jinja-honcho . )
** name
under the classification of religious services , reisai are classified as ' taisai ' .
for that reason , reisai are sometimes called rei-taisai ( regular grand festival ) .
however , this is a colloquial name , not the formal one ( although some reisai are popularly referred to as ' xxxx shrine rei-taisai festival ' ) .
** the formal name is taisaishikireisai ( regular festival in the form of grand festival ) .
** religious services other than the formal ' reisai ' sometimes include the word ' reisai ' in their name ( e . g . ' spring reisai festival ' ) , but there is only one reisai in one shrine .
** date of head shrine ' s reisai
** there is no concept of ' reisai ' at ise-jingu shrine .
however , kannamesai ( held on oct . 00 ) , which is the shrine ' s most important religious service , is equivalent to the reisai performed at ordinary shrines .
** rei-taisai
** rei-taisai is the common name of the most important reisai ( regular festival ) that is performed on a day associated with the shrine .
** reisai are classified as ' taisai ' ( grand festival ) according to the rules of religious services stipulated by jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) .
therefore , reisai are usually called rei-taisai .
their formal name is taisaishikireisai ( literally ' regular festival in the form of grand festival ' ) .
in some cases , a festival may be described as ' xxxx shrine reitaisai festival ' in information about the shrine but it only means a festival performed as reisai .
for instance , the reisai of kashihara-jingu shrine is called kigensai and the reisai of iwashimizu hachimangu shrine is called iwashimizu-sai festival and the like , but the reisai of tsurugaoka hachiman-gu shrine is called ' reitaisai festival . '
** for more details , see the article on reisai .
** shrine shinto
** origin of the term ' shrine shinto '
** shrine shinto is a form of shinto .
the word has two meanings as follows :
** another term for ' state shinto ' before world war ii .
see state shinto .
** the form of shinto that , since world war ii , has been centered on shrines , shinto services and rituals performed by organizations made up of ujiko ( residents of a shinto parish ) and sukeisha ( believers living outside the shinto parish ) .
** today , ' shinto ' refers to shrine shinto .
saishi ( religious services ) are held at shrines , of which there are many across japan .
most of them are supervised by jinja-honcho ( the association of shinto shrines ) .
since shrine shinto has no scriptures , saishi are performed as per shinto writings such as " kojiki " ( the record of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
saishi are performed by shinto priests .
jinja-honcho awards qualifications to people who have completed the designated training .
** the term ' shrine shinto ' is relatively new .
it was created to distinguish shrine shinto from sect shinto after the meiji period .
between the meiji period and the end of world war ii , shrine shinto was protected by the government because ' it was not a religion . '
from somewhere around the end of meiji , it was called state shinto .
furthermore , influential scholars developed the theory of national shinto and divided it into ' kokutai shinto ' ( national structure shinto ) and ' shrine shinto .
before world war ii , shrine shinto signified rituals , thought and organization in shrines that were brought under government control with the arrival of the modern age .
** jade magatama
** magatama and diplomacy
** jade magatama refers to magatama made of jade .
** they are believed to have been made of japanese jade at workshops in japan .
in particular , excavations at the ' chojagahara site ' in itoigawa have revealed a workshop for processing jade , as well as jade magatama .
** for this reason , scholars in prewar japan took the jade magatama as proof of the sphere of influence of wa ( japan ) , but post-war archaeologists , at one time , advocated a new interpretation that they had been introduced to japan from korea .
** this shows wa ' s sphere of influence , and it is believed that jadeite magatama were introduced to the korean peninsula from wa .
** in addition , " book of sui , vol . 00 , liezhuan ( biographies ) 00 " states ' silla and baekje respect wa as a big power with unusual cultural products and send envoys to wa . '
** eirei
** summary
** eirei is a ' term used to honor the spirits of dead persons who performed an outstanding act . '
today , it can be a politically or ideologically controversial subject .
** since the greater east asia war ( second world war ) , it has sometimes been used to refer to the spirits of self-defense force officials who have died in the line of duty .
therefore , it is often pointed out that using the word ' eirei ' for every person who died in war ( the war dead ) is wrong .
** consequently , the word often refers to military men in many cases but it is not necessarily limited to them .
this means that death in battle , in other words being killed in action ( or being executed by the enemy ) is not what it takes to be eirei .
** yasukuni-jinja shrine also collectively enshrines military men who died of illness during the war ( those that were taken ill and died after going to war , not killed in battle ) .
on the other hand , self-defense force personnel who die in the line of duty will be enshrined together at gokoku-jinja shrine ( through the association of former members ) , not at yasukuni-jinja shrine .
** the concept of eirei
in the shinto view of souls , even after a person dies , the soul lives on eternally , and souls that have been enshrined and appeased will become sorei ( ancestral spirits , usually ones which have lost their individuality ) to watch over descendants .
** thus , in shinto , which dates back to ancient times , worship of sorei by descendants related by blood has existed from the start , although the concept of ' eirei ' did not exist .
however , in village communities , there arose a belief in ujigami ( a guardian god or spirit of a particular place ) .
in addition , under the ancient political system with the emperor at its center , goryo-shinko ( the belief that spirits intimidate society ) was established to deal with vengeful spirits , and thus malevolent gods were enshrined and appeased .
the concept of ' eirei ' is perceived as stemming from ujigami and goryo-shinko .
** eirei are to be publicly honored , and it is the fact that ' they died for the emperor ' that should be honored .
after the war , the emperor denied being an absolute god ( arahitogami : kami who appears in this world in human form ) .
when the absolute god-emperor ceased to exist after the war , the spirits of the war dead became the object to be appeased .
this means that , since the war , there are no eirei at yasukuni-jinja shrine because the object to be publicly honored does not exist there .
the spirits were supposed to be appeased , carried away by water and become gods to bring blessings to people .
however , yasukuni-jinja shrine calls them eirei on the presumption that the non-existent absolute god-emperor exists .
** after the war , some buddhist practitioners have reflected on having enshrined ' spirits ' that contradict buddhism and on having been subservient to the concept of eirei .
** now ' eirei ' is regarded as one of the core elements in the doctrine of ' state shinto . '
** holy war : your own country ' s act of hostility is always right , and taking part in it is a noble duty .
( =hegemonism )
** eirei : those who engage in such a battle and die will become gods .
therefore , we enshrine the dead .
** kensho ( honoring ) : make them ( eirei ) a model and follow their example .
** he also points out in the same article that ' by using the religious tricks of holy war doctrine and eirei doctrine , state shinto window-dresses the political purpose of involving people in acts of aggression which is embedded in the doctrine of honoring . '
** meaning of 英 ( ei )
they are called ' mudabana ' or ' adabana ' in japanese .
taking into account that one reading of a character never conveniently refers to one thing and that a character has a variety of meanings , eirei can be seen as a perfect word .
** toyokumono
** toyokumono is a shinto deity appearing in the story of the creation of heaven and earth ( the japanese mythology ) .
he is a god of kamiyonanayo ( seven generations ) .
toyokumono is described as toyokumono no kami 豊雲野神 in kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , and as toyokumune no mikoto 豊斟渟尊 in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
** descriptions in mythology
in kojiki , toyokumono was the second one to come into being as kamiyonanayo following kuninotokotachi no kami .
he was regarded as hitorigami ( a kami which came into being alone ) like kuninotokotachi no kami , and hid himself away just after coming into being .
** since many of their names include the kanji character ' toyo ' ( 豊 ) , they are regarded to have the same divinity as toyokumono no kami or toyokumune no mikoto has .
from arufumi vol . 0 to vol . 0 , there are no god ' s name , which seems to be identical to this deity .
** from this point forward , toyokumono no kami never appears in any stories of kojiki and nihonshoki .

since toyokumono appears only by name in mythology , and there is nothing except his name that offers any clue as to his divinity , and can be interpreted in various ways .
** taking his other name of toyokunino no mikoto as an example , " kojikiden " ( commentaries on the kojiki ) describes that the name symbolizes an abundant profitable country .
** one theory is that ' kumo , ' ' kumi , ' or ' kuni ' used in his name means ' seclude , ' or ' assemble , ' symbolizing the way something drifting like floating grease gradually sticks together .
another theory is that ' kumo ' or ' kumu ' used in his name mean ' among the trees , ' symbolizing the land where trees grow .

** shimotsuki kagura
** summary
** typical shimotsuki kagura
** shimotsuki kagura is kagura ( sacred music and dance performed at shrines ) that is performed in november ( according to the old lunar calendar ; december through to january of the following year according to the gregorian calendar ) .
** the eleventh month of the old lunar calendar was a period when gods and nature became weak , so kagura was performed to prepare for the new year , refreshing and restoring souls in rites such as tamafuri ( shaking of souls ) .
yudate , a mixture of the kumano cult rebirth rites yu no kiyomari ( purification by hot water ) and igomori no juho ( incantation of confining ) , is said to have been handed down from that time .
** around the pot , various prayers , norito ( ritual prayers ) , and dances such as kagura by jinin ( shrine associates ) are performed through the night .
** in particular , deities low in rank but having a close connection to the local area were warmly received .
** the following are typical shimotsuki kagura .
other kagura continue to practice either the whole or part of traditional shimotsuki kagura but are not mentioned here .

** mikumari no kami
** mikumari no kami is a shinto deity ( shinto ) .
** as its name suggests , this god is in charge of water distribution .
the word ' kumari ' used in its name means ' distribution , ' so it is enshrined in the fountainhead or the watershed of a waterway .
** in the story of kamiumi ( the birth of the kami ) in the japanese mythology , ameno mikumari no kami and kunino mikumari no kami appear as children of two gods , hayaakitsuhiko and hayaakitsuhime .
** since it is the god associated with water , it becomes the central object in a rainmaking rite ; this god is also linked to the god of rice fields and harvests , and the one enshrined in the fountainhead is combined with the mountain god .
later , the word ' mikumari ' is interpreted as ' mikomori ' ( child nursing ) , so the god is worshiped as the guardian deity of children , or the god of pregnancy and smooth delivery .
** shimenawa rope
** summary
** meotoiwa ( pairs of rock outcrops near each other ) are well know examples of this practice .
** worship of nature has existed since ancient times in ancient forms of shinto .
** forms
** the shimenawa rope ( sacred straw rope ) is a ceremonial article of significance in shinto and , the rope has religious meaning when adorned with shide ( zigzag shaped paper talisman ) .
shimenawa ropes are also called ' 0-0-0 ropes . '
** in current day shrine based shinto , the rope takes the role of and demarcating the shrine and precincts from the every-day world .
also , the surrounds of the shrine and places where deities reside are enclosed by shimenawa ropes .
consecrated ground falls within these confines and , the ropes are a spiritual cleansing barrier warding off misfortune and evil .
as mitamashiro ( revered deity spirits and objects ) and yorishiro ( objects representing divine spirits ) the ropes convey a sense that the gods can reside in that location .
** in shinto of ancient times , consecrated ground was eternal , whereas this world was a transient representation of the real world .
the shimenawa rope represented the border and barrier between those two worlds and in some situations signified a prohibited area .
shimenawa ropes are hung around : places where portable festival shrines are stored , reef outcrops in the sea , unusually shaped rock formations etc .
** these form one type of shimenawa rope which symbolizes a barrier warding off evil and misfortune .
from among the ozeki ( second highest rank ) of sumo wrestling , only particular select wrestlers are to be permitted to tie the shimenawa rope that goes around the waist of the yokozuna ( grand champion ) .
** currently , places where lightning strikes ( in particular when in rice paddies ) are cordoned off with green bamboo from which a shimenawa rope is then strung around . it is the custom in various regions of japan to then pray for a bountiful crop .
** origins
** japanese mythology
** beliefs related to the rice harvest
beliefs related to the rice harvest are a fundamental thread running through shinto .
** customs and traditions that accompany the rice harvest culture are thought to run deep .
** ancient shinto
** religious beliefs that include beliefs that deities are enshrined in mountains and forests are called ' kannabi . '
** shimenawa come in many various forms : standard shimenawa , ornamented shimenawa , daikon ( giant radish ) shimenawa , burdock shimenawa , ring shimenawa etc .
** daikon ( giant radish ) shimenawa taper at both ends and , burdock shimenawa are thinner at just one end .
** religious use of ropes other than in japan .
in the central southern part of korea a similar custom called ' kumchul ' ( 금줄/禁縄 ) exists .
displaying shimenawa
forms representing the gods are displayed for worship in the new year .
those displayed in the entranceways of homes are called ' tamakazari , ' those on display in the kitchen and bathrooms of a home are somewhat simpler and called ' wajime ' ( hoop ropes ) .
tamakazari differ from region to region in japan however , zigzag paper talisman , bitter orange ( citrus aurantium ) and fern with white-backed leaves ( sorbus japonica ) are often used together in decorations .
timing of decorations
the first day for shimenawa decorations is ideally thought to be the same as when new year ' s pine decorations are put on show however , customs differ from region to region .
currently , decorations are commonly put on display after christmas and up until the 00th .
putting up decorations between the 00th and 00st is considered bad luck .
decorations put up on the 00st are only up for one night which is considered rude to the incoming gods .
the custom of the day decorations are taken down also differs from region to region .
on january 0 , after 0 herb congee has been eaten or , the after the 00th ( the minor/former new year ) is when decorations are removed .
** hinohakama
** colors vary widely depending on the redness of the thread : from vermillion through to deep violet .
** whether it was because red was avoided due to an association between misfortune or good luck , bright orange hakama were worn .
** hinohakama ( scarlet hakama ( divided trouser-like skirt ) ) ( also known as ' hibakama ' ) is also called ' kutenai no hakama ' ( red hakama ) because of its deep scarlet color and to indicate the red thread used in the hakama .
even to this day it is the costume worn by shrine maidens .
** the ' uchi bakama ' , ' hari-bakama ' forms of the hakama ( divided trouser-like skirt ) were the original forms of the hakama worn formally by court ladies in the heian period .
the hakama itself was worn high on the waist and then a cord tied front and back around the waist then secured by hooking on the right side and allowing the cord to hang down .
** after gaining popularity , an ' andon ' version of the scarlet red hakama was also made .
most of the scarlet red hakama worn these days are orthodox ' andon ' hakama .
** however , safflower dyes were expensive and associated with the idea of fire so , were from time to time subject to prohibition edicts but , this made no difference .
in the year 000 , kiyoyuki miyoshi published an opinion piece included in ' seiji yoryaku ' ( examples of heian period politics ) where he mentions dissatisfaction with the scarlet hakama fad .
colors
in general , the hakama worn by ladies at court etc were said to have been scarlet hakama and , the shade of the garment differed according to the age of the wearer .
very young females ( little girls in heian period japan , unmarried adult women in the edo period ) did not wear red but instead , wore hakama of deep violet .
** currently as well , costumes worn at court and the costumes of temple maidens retain vestiges of this custom .
** bright orange also has associations with forgetting so , is worn to convey a sense of healing the sorrow of separations .
also , during the heian period when people moved house , to ward off ' fire ' white hakama were worn instead of red however , by the end of the kamakura period , this practice seems to have died out .
accessories
as with the hakama worn when performing religious tasks , the hakama is adorned with a cord .
from the front it can ' t be determined if the cord is knotted however , this can be seen from the back .
also , even with the same scarlet hakama , the cheap costume dress-up version often omits the cord accessory .
** chihaya
** the chihaya ( outer vestment garment ) has existed in japan since ancient times and is a piece of clothing used when performing religious rituals and duties that is principally worn by women .
** originally worn on the outside of costumes , the chihaya is simply made of solely of plain white cloth one bolt length wide with a cut made purposely in the middle for the wearer to put their head through .
the chihaya was worn over the sleeves of clothes worn when performing religious rituals and duties which were rolled up into the chihaya .
it is said the chihaya was worn to make movement easier .
** furthermore , it was made by using two bolt widths of fabric with the front of the garment hanging below the chest and the back of the garment extending longer than the front .
the armpit of the garment was not stitched closed and the garment was worn tied at the front with a cord thus having evolved into a short piece of clothing with no sleeves .
in more recent times , instead of plain white cloth , aozuri ( cloth dyed deep blue ) made using indigo to paint flowers , plants and streams is primarily used .

** sculpture of deities
** a sculpture of deities is a statue or a portrait to represent kami , an object of worship .
** in japan , many are modeled after shinto deities , and some originate from taoistic gods .
** in shinto , traditionally , yorishiro ( an object capable of attracting kami ) such as mirrors , jewels , and swords are worshiped .
** idol worship trend probably comes from the suijaku theory ( shinto and buddhist syncretism ) .
** sculptures of deities were made by believers in anthropomorphism .

** hatsuho
** in japan , hatsuho is a ripe rice ear presented to god ( shinto ) before autumn rice harvest .
it is also called hayaho , sakiho , or saika .
** it is said that in ancient times , a local ruling family who spearheaded saishi ( religious service ) collected hatsuho from subjects in order to cover the expenses or to use it as altarage .
today , the ise-jingu shrine holds nuibo-sai festival ( rice-harvesting ceremony ) before kanname-sai festival ( ceremony for offering of the first fruits ) .
** some other shrines and local areas have a nukiho ( picking rice ears ) event before autumn harvest festival ( hassaku ( august 0 on lunar calendar ) , choyo ( september 0th ) , etc ) , too .
this is considered the original form of hatsuho .
originally , the literal meaning of hatsuho was rice ear .
later , the meaning was expanded to something other than grain .
vegetables , seafoods or hunted animals which are gained and presented to shinto and buddhist deities at the beginning of the year were also called hatsuho .
in addition , hatsuho later represents the money offered in place of primeur .
today , the money offered to shrine is called ' hatsuho-ryo ' ( ceremony fee ) which was derived from this .
when rice is offered , rice grains in place of rice ears are thrown in an event called ' sanmai ' ( throwing rice ) or they are offered in the form of ' wrapped offering ' which is wrapped with white paper .
furthermore , cooked rice or rice cake became available as hatsuho .
** haniyasu
** haniyasu is the god of soil ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
** hani ' used in its name stands for clay , and ' haniyasu ' means to knead soil to become soft .
** it is one of gods that born between izanagi and izanami at kamiumi ( the birth of the kami ) .
nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) describes her as haniyasu no kami .
according to kojiki ( roderods of ancient matters ) , haniyasuhiko no kami and haniyasubime no kami came into being from feces of izanami , who was about to die after giving birth to the god of fire .
** in jichinsai ( a shinto ground-breaking ceremony to pacify the local guardian spirits ) , this god is sometimes worshiped as the god of soil together with other deities .
** izuna-gongen
** origin
** izuna-gongen ( also pronounced as iizuna-gongen ) is a syncretized god of shintoism and buddhism which is said to originate from a belief in the mountains of mt . izuna in minochi county , shinano province ( now nagano prefecture ) .
in many cases it is expressed as a karasu tengu ( crow-billed goblin ) riding a white fox with a sword and rope .
sometimes snakes wind around its whole body or the white fox .
generally it is enshrined as a god of victory , and used to be believed by warlords in the middle age including yoshimitsu ashikaga , kenshin uesugi , and shingen takeda .
it is especially famous that the ornament in front of the helmet of kenshin uesugi was a statue of izuna-gongen .
** more specifically , it is an illustration of tactics using fire in which one ties the legs of a bird on the back of a fox and set fire to the wings and send them to the castle of enemy .
it also holds a memorial service for those foxes and birds which brought victory .
** meanwhile ' izuna tactics ' initiated by izuna-gongen came to be regarded as an improper tactic along with ' atago tactics ' and ' dakini tenpo tactics . '
while it was regarded as an abnormal tactic that used tengu ( a mountain spirit , portrayed as winged and having a long nose ) and foxes , it penetrated as a popular belief
these tactics were described as follows . ' there is an improper tactic called izuna no jutsu which confuses human eyes . ' ( " bosou manroku " )
burn powder incense of shikimi ( japanese star anis ) for the buddha as well as in the world . '
when one uses izuna tactics , he will not be blamed for his improper tactics if he burns this powder incense . ' ( " yamato honzo " )
nevertheless this god is earnestly believed especially in the kanto region and the north including izuna-jinja shrine in shinshu and takaosan yakuo-in temple on mt . takao ( takao-cho , hachioji city , tokyo prefecture ) , apart from regions with vulgar beliefs .
it is called izuna-gongen or izuna-myojin .
** belief in izuna-gongen is described slightly differently between each engi ( writing about the history ) and saimon ( address to the gods ) .
an oldest reference whose creation date is known is found in " togakushiyama kenko-ji ruki , narabini jo " ( around muromachi era ) and it describes as follows ;
i am the third tengu in japan . '
i wish to serve on the side of this mountain , and escape from the three kinds of heat with gracious wind from ( kuzuryu ) gongen ( incarnation ) . '
i should be raised to the gyokudai ( jewel pedestal ) of jinshi . '
i shall be chinju ( local shinto deity ) of this mountain . '
" togakushiyama kenko-ji ruki , narabini jo " is an engi which refers mainly to the origin in togakushi , and describes how izuna-myojin becomes a guardian bestowing gracious winds from togakushi gongen to illustrate the secondary position of izuna-myojin .
** on the other hand in " izunayama ryakuengi " during the edo period , izunadaimyojin is referred to as ' it worships otonoji no mikoto , the fifth child of tenjin , and its honji ( original ground or true nature ) is dainichi nyorai ( mahavairocana ) '
** this statement is relevant to the above-mentioned " togakushiyama kenko-ji ruki , narabini jo . "
** shugen related to mt . izuna is called ' izuna shugen , ' and a practitioner , known as sennichi-dayu , served as a leader for generations .
in early-modern times nishina clan served as sennichi-dayu and ruled 000 koku ( 0 koku is about 000 liters ; an old unit of volume ) of izuna shinryo estate .
it is likely that the izuna belief at mt . izuna was formed in later ages around this sennichi-dayu .
** taking into consideration the descriptions including engi and izuna-koshiki , it can be assumed that a systematic izuna belief was already formed in the beginning of the middle ages .
** development
izuna belief has many varieties , ranging from belief in devils and tengu , to beliefs among warlords , practitioners , and ninja ( professional spy in feudal japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy ) , to beliefs in foxes , which are complicated aspects of the belief .
though we have to wait accumulation of researches in the future on the realities , it seems it was partly regarded as a magic or improper tactics already in muromachi period .
** ohanjin
** today ohanjin is deified as a guardian deity of a village as guardians for the community , but was originally a snake god called rafu in the indian myth and was feared as a god who brings disasters .
after it was introduced to japan it was syncretized with susano , a deity who caused eclipse .
** it is also one of hasshojin ( eight general gods ) which control good and bad directions .
it is also called hakanokata as well as a god of war .
it would bring bad luck to move soil to the direction of this god while it brings good luck regarding warfare .
** though as a result of syncretization it is categorized as a god , ohanjin is deeply related to buddhism , especially esoteric buddhism .
** varieties
ohanjin looks very similar to doso-jin ( a god who prevents evil spirits from coming ) in appearance , but can be distinguished by the following features .
** moji-ohanjin

** jodai , mainly nara era ( nara period )
** ancient times ( heian period )
** medieval period ( kamakura period and muromachi period )
** early modern times ( edo period )
** modern times
** kotoage ( word rising ) ritual is to make the religious principle or interpretation in shinto clear by word .
** this example is considered to be the oldest one in existence .
yamato takeru ( no mikoto ) was killed by a curse of god because the kotoage ritual he did came from self-conceit .
** however , in the broad sense , ' words ' should contain elements other than voice , such as ' gesture . '
most of current shinto schools who are said to value a gesture ( motion ) are also considered to attach importance to ' words ' in broad sense ( language . )
however , shintoists themselves declare that ' shinto does not do kotoage ritual ' ( see below ) .
** currently , shintoists tend to avoid the dispute over shinto .
** essential history of ' kotoage ' ritual
** yamato takeru ( no mikoto ) found in " kojiki "

** manyoshu ( collection of ten thousand leaves )
one verse of kakinomoto no hitomaro says , ' ashihara no mizuho no kuni does not do kotoage ritual even if he is a god . '

** ansai yamazaki
ansai yamazaki was against buddhism as a confucian scholar , and actively promoted a fusion of confucianism and shinto , advocating suika shinto ( shinto thoughts advocated by ansai yamazaki ) .
he reinterpreted the relationship between gods and men as a relationship between lord and vassal in light of confucianism .
** atsutane hirata
atsutane hirata read books related to christianity although those books were prohibited , and introduced the concept of the god of creation into shinto .
trying to interpret kojiki , he emphasized ame no minakanushi no kami ( one of the gods in japanese mythology ) as the god of ' creation . '
likewise , he interpreted okuninushi no kami as the ruler of yukai ( world after death ) or yominokuni ( realm of the dead ) , whom susanoo met when he went there .
atsutane hirata considered the world to consist of the ' yukai ' and real world , and created the idea that the one who rules the ' genkai ' ( the real world ) is the emperor .
this idea served as a theoretical base for the meiji restoration , and caused izumo-ha school , which enshrined okuninushi no kami , to emerge in early modern times .
** dispute over the enshrined deity of shinto shrine jimukyoku
dispute from 0000 through 0000
religious principle dispute over the enshrined deity of the shrine of shinto jimukyoku ( bureau ) which was established in hibiya , tokyo .
shrine of shinto jimukyoku selected , as the enshrined deity of the jimukyoku , yohashira ( four gods ) including ' zoka-sanshin ' ( three gods of creation ) : ame no minakanushi no kami ; takamimusubi no kami ; kamimusubi no kami ; and amaterasu omikami .
upholding the belief called ' yuken ichinyo ' ( unity of the world after death and the actual world ) , izumo-ha school argued that okuninushi no kami should be included as an enshrined deity to form itsuhashira ( five gods ) .
eventually , this dispute was sorted out by an imperial decision made by emperor meiji ( it was determined to be a yohaiden ( a shrine to worship gods from afar ) of the three shrines in the imperial court ; izumo-ha school was virtually defeated ) .
the government is said to have realized that it would not be possible for the modern state to either develop a common religious principle code or directly rule citizens using fukko shinto ( returning to the ancient shinto ) .

** analysis of the state shinto ' s creed
there has been no ' state shinto ' s creed that the ' state shinto ' itself explicitly stated .
however , masaharu hishiki organized state shinto ' s creed into three points below , saying that some religion disregard verbally expressing their creeds , but those creeds can be extracted easily by using the result of philosophy of religion and cultural anthropology .
** 0 . holy war : one ' s country ' s conflict is always right , and it is one ' s sublime duty to participate in it .
** 0 . eirei ( spirits of the war dead ) : one can become a god when he engages in a holy war , and dies .
therefore , the dead are to be celebrated .
** 0 . honoring : on the model of eirei , all follow suit .
** then he pointed out that ' those are to embellish a political purposes of driving people to aggressive war which is hidden in honoring creed . '
there is another argument that the state shinto ' s creed center around the thought of arahitogami ( kami ( god ) who appears in this world in human form ) or the thought of an unbroken imperial line .
** kannagi
** chinese characters representing kannagi include " 巫 " and " 神なぎ ( 神和ぎ・神薙ぎ・神凪 ) , " which are also read as " kaminagi " or " kamunagi . "
kannagi ( 巫 ) refers to acts of yorishiro ( object representative of a divine spirit ) , dependence on gods , or communication with gods .
it also refers to persons who carry out such acts .
for more details , refer to the section of " fu " or " kannagi " ( 巫 ) ( a person who serves and sings for and invites gods ) .
** summary
** kannagi ( 神なぎ ) and kannagi ( 巫 )
these words are related mainly to koshinto ( as practiced prior to the introduction of confucianism and buddhism to japan ) , referring to acts of persons involved in the two aspects of a god--a tranquil god and a savage god .
** even today people believe in shinboku ( sacred tree ) , mt . fuji as sacred mountain , and inazuma ( thunderbolt ; a bolt of lightning ) as faith in rice cropping .
** there have been kannagi ( written as 巫 ) as prayers and dependence on gods which led to shrine shinto and kannagi ( written as 神和ぎ ) as awe ( fear ) of , respect for , and thanks for nature in koshinto since ancient times .
these two kannagi , which are common in some parts and inseparable , are alive even today and are typical in japan .
** acts as kannagi ( written as 神和ぎ )
** matsuri
matsuri ( festival )
** matsuri here means so-called festivals whose purpose is to console the spirit , give thanks to gods , be admitted in their presence , and demonstrate and change residence .
** matsuri ( dedication to gods )
** the chinese character of this matsuri is also read as " tatematsuru , " which means that gods stand ' high above ' and ' serve as a guardian , ' who ' protect people . '
** revering and having a feeling of awe for gods is believed as a matter of course .
people ' s comforting gods acts as a warning to prevent people from becoming too arrogant , and face retaliation by nature .
** matsuri ( prayer )
** building a shrine
yorishiro is necessary to comfort gods as an object before which people pray ( although not in all cases ) ; for example , a great shrine ( not existing ) of izumo-taisha shrine , and himorogi or iwakura--a natural object regarded as yorishiro-- were built in ancient times .
with the establishment of shrine shinto , ' shines ( yashiro ) ' were built , and there are said to be tens of thousands of them in japan .
in addition , many monuments and mounts were built so that those who died in conflicts and wars would not become araburu kami .
such monuments and tumuli can be found throughout japan , for example in the name of a mound for weapons and tumulus for mongol warriors .
furthermore , monuments for fish and mounds for whales are seen throughout japan as a repose of souls of living things who died for food , and served as kannagi .
** kannagi
the meanings of kannagi varies depending on the chinese characters and according to japanese mythology .
** kannagi written as " 神和ぎ " means ' shinto rituals ' to bring calmness to gods ' souls .
kannagi written as " 神薙ぎ " means ' shinto rituals ' to pray for plentiful crops in farm lands and prosperous agriculture as well as the prevention of landslides , wind or storm damage , and other disasters in remote mountainous areas .
kannagi written as " 神凪 " means ' shinto rituals ' to pray for large catches and safe fishing as well as the prevention of tidal waves and other disasters in coastal areas .
** aramitama and nigimitama ( rough god and tranquil god )
according to shinto ' s view of world , there are tokoyo ( the perpetual world ) and utsusho ( the actual world ) ; utsushiyo is where people live and tokoyo is considered to be where gods live or the sacred area .
the tokoyo further consists of two worlds .
** the one written as " 常世 " is so called the heaven--the world of eternal youth and immortality without nights in which wisdoms are brought .
the other written as " 常夜 " is so called the hell , the realm of the dead , or yominokuni ( hades ) --the world only with nights in which misfortunes and disasters are brought .
** in this way the world of shinto has two aspects .
** these two aspects are seen in common with the idea that gods bring fortunes on some occasions but misfortunes on others .
therefore gods are expressed as aramitama and nigimitama ( araburu kami and nagiru kami ( tranquil gods ) ) depending on the occasion .
this idea is identical to the view of nature held by the japanese .
gods were considered to be capricious beings , sometimes they provided rain in proper amounts , but served floods when they gave too much rain .
** tsukumogami ( god of great age and experience )
shinto is rather vague with no script and has so many gods in any form of natural things that they are called yao yorozu no kami ( eight million gods ) --meaning that there are countless number of gods .
there are differences in terms of the superiority or grade ; things that live long or are used long are respected as having a strong force .
thus gods are believed to dwell in a wide variety of tools and living things and such gods are called tsukumogami .
such gods are believed to become a so-called " yokai " ( specter ) and bring misfortune when malignant and happiness when tranquil .
** this shows affections to long-lived things as a symbol of nature and appreciations to long-used tools , serving as a warning that a misfortune may occur when these things are handled without due respect .
** ichirei shikon
** history of ichirei shikon
** the structure of ichirei shikon
** functions of four souls
** naohi ' s function
** growth of souls
** the function of magahi spirit
** ichirei shikon ( one spirit , four souls ) is an idea of japanese shintoism in which the mind consists of a spirit called ' naohi ' that is connected with the heaven and four souls .
** the idea that the mind consists of a spirit called ' naohi ' that is connected with the heaven and four souls is called ichirei shikon .
chikaatsu honda , a scholar of japanese classical literature from the end of edo period to meiji period , described a definite idea of ' ichirei shikon . '
** according to ' ichirei shikon , ' the human ' s mind is considered to consist of four souls , which a ' spirit ' controls .
this is the ' structure of the human mind ' of ichirei shikon .
** aramitama , nigimitama , sachimitama , and kushimitama have different functions of souls , courage , relation , love , and wisdom , respectively .
naohi controls them .
to put them simply , courage is a force for going forward ; relation is a force for closely communicating with others ; love is a force for loving and bringing up others ; and wisdom is a force for observing , analyzing and understanding things .
** naohi gives feedback of these four functions , acting like a conscience .
for example , when the function of wisdom works too much , the naohi calls for reflection by suggesting , : ' you may be hated with too much analysis and evaluations . '
in other words , this naohi has a function of ' reflection . '
** courage
aramitama
" courage , " a function of aramitama is a force for going forward .
it means the force for going forward not only fearlessly but also patiently and steadily .
this function is described as ' 勇 , ' in one chinese character .
extroverted persons with power of action can be said to have aramitama .
** relation
nigimitama
the soul ' s second function is nigimitama , a force for having close communications .
this function is described as ' 親 , ' in one chinese character .
persons who desire peace and go along with others can be said to have nigimitama .
** love
sachimitama ( or sakimitama )
the soul ' s third function is sachimitama , a force for loving and bringing up others .
this function is described as ' 愛 , ' in one chinese character .
persons who think kindness and feeling important and seek mutual understanding can be said to have sachimitama .
** wisdom
kushimitama
the soul ' s fourth function is kushimitama , which is an intelligence comprising of observation ability , analytic ability , and understanding ability .
persons who seek the truth can be said to have sachimitama .
** naohi whose function is described as ' 省 ' with one chinese character can polish the four souls by reflecting what was done is proper or not .
naohi can distinguish right from wrong to guide the human so that it will not make mistakes , and calls for reflection , self reproach and repentance when mistakes occurs .
** only this naohi can be connected with ' heaven ' and has a function to polish the four souls by controlling them .
it gives feedback to aramitama through shame , to nigimitama remorse , to sakitama through awe , and to kushimitama through notice .
** these four kinds of feedbacks are based on the function of ' reflection . '
these four feelings plus reflection are called a discipline of five feelings .
** the four souls are polished by naohi to grow in four phases .
** the first phase ' a virtue '
the condition in which only one out of the four souls has grown well is called having ' a virtue . '
it is believed that a person having only one virtue grown can go to heaven .
** the second phase ' two virtues '
the condition in which two souls have grown well is called having " two virtues . "
there are six combinations of two souls : courage plus relation , love plus wisdom , courage plus love , courage plus wisdom , love plus relation , and relation plus wisdom .
strictly speaking , there are twelve combinations because the order of two chinese characters can be opposite .
** the third phase ' three virtues '
the condition in which the three souls have grown well is called having ' three virtues ' with a total of four combinations : courage/wisdom/love , courage/relation/love , courage/relation/wisdom , and relation/wisdom/love .

** shiniki
** summery
** the importance of shiniki in shinto
** present status of shiniki
** contemporary usage of the term
** shiniki is precincts of a shrine or a place where gods dwell ( yorishiro ) .
** or deriving from it , the term shiniki is also used in referring to an important place .
** in koshinto ( the ancient shinto ) , himorogi ( a temporarily erected sacred space or " altar " used as a locus of worship ) and iwakura ( dwelling place of a god , usually in reference to a large rock ) are yorishiro of gods .
at the same time ' rogi ' ( 籬 ) from himorogi ( 神籬 ) meaning ' a fence ' and iwakura , also called iwa-saka ( saka means a border ) both signify borders of shiniki .
quite a few places are kinsokuchi ( tabooed land ) .
as for okino-shima island , not only the shrine and the forest but also the whole island is shiniki , furthermore kinsokuchi .
** although it is little known to the general public , basically sando ( the approach to shinto shrine ) is an approach for gods who descend and live in shrines .
since the center of sando is shiniki and tabooed , visitors must walk along the side of sando .
** in koshinto and shinto , kekkai can be considered to be a representation of taboo in a certain space .
kekkai ( 結界 ) also functions to connect ( 結 ) two worlds ( 界 ) that are a sacred area ( tokoyo ) and a profane area ( ustushiyo ) .
** what kind of characteristic does shiniki have in shinto ?
it is the most essential area to enshrine and serve deities .
shiniki is necessary as the land where shinen ( shrine garden ) is made or jingi ( the sacred treasures ) are enshrined .
shiniki is also required when chozusha ( purification trough ) is provided .
making shin-en is to please the enshrined deities with trees , mosses , flowers and fruits .
** today shiniki can be regarded just as an event site .
in our daily life , shiniki is considered as a place for stalls .
it is sometimes used for human activities rather than serving the deities .
** in fact , entertainment , such as tokyo ska paradise orchestra concert in heian-jingu shrine , are occasionally held due to its open space .
** shiniki tends to be used for such entertainment since it was originally established as open space for shinto rituals .
** today shin-iki mainly signifies an important place .
for example , it is used such as ' mt . everest is shiniki for mountain climbers , ' ' hollywood is shiniki for cineast . '
these often indicate a starting point or a finishing goal to the person in question .
** it is used not only as a place but also as an important part .
it is applied to emphasize objects , for example , ' a mortar is shiniki of driving power mechanics , ' ' riemann ' s hypothesis is shiniki of mathematics . '
its usage is similar to that of " mecca . "

** tanokami ( deity of rice fields and harvests ) is a deity ( shinto religion ) that japanese agricultural people believe watches over a rich or poor harvest and brings about a bumper crop of rice .
it is called no-gami or a peasant priest .
** it is known that there were folkways to enshrine agricultural gods in ancient japan .
** " norito ( shinto prayer ) of otono-hogai " of " engishiki " ( codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) describes that , in particular , toyoukebime-no-kami as inadama with a note that it is also commonly known as ukano-mitama .
in this regard , kunio yanagita suggests that miko ( a shrine maiden ) making rituals for the soul of rice were integrated into a god to be worshiped and thus the agricultural god came to be regarded as a goddess .
** linked with other beliefs of different origins , tanokami is commonly regarded as ebisu ( god of fishing and commerce ) in eastern japan and daikokuten ( mahakala ) in wewtern japan .
tanokami may be further identified as an earthly deity ( chijin ) or inari-shin ( the god of harvest ) but clearly differentiated from the fishing god and fukutoku-shin ( a god who brings fortune and luck ) .
** this belief is called shunju kyorai ( coming and going in spring and autumn ) of tanokami and yamanokami , which was prevalent across the country .
shunnshukyorai=>shunju kyorai
** according to a legend handed down in murakami city , niigata prefecture ( formerly sanpoku-machi , iwafune-gun ( nigata prefecture ) ) , for example , tanokami is believed to come from tenjiku ( india ) and descend on houses on march 00 .
tanokami is then believed to leave the houses to their paddy fields on april 00 and revisit the houses on october 00 .
people conducted rituals to offer botamochi rice cake to ebisu ( god of fishing and commerce ) on these days believing that tanokami returned again to tenjiku on november 00 .
tanokami moves place to place among tehjiku , houses , and fields in a year .
these moves almost match the yearly process of rice cultivation .
** this kind of folklore of tanokami coming and going through houses is commonly found and have as follows .
** tanokami returns home from paddy fields .
** tanokami leaves home to paddy fields .
** tanokami descends on houses from mountains .
** tanokami returns to the mountain from houses .
** tanokami comes and goes to and from houses and paddy fields .
** tanokami becomes rusu-gami ( caretaking-gods ) instead of coming and going .
** and other patterns exist in folklore .
like the example of sanpoku-machi above , some folklores contain distant places such as tenjiku from which tanokami comes and goes .
** they also had an event to send the tanokami from home to the field at the beginning of spring ( on february 0 originally january 0 ) .
** scarecrows were regarded as yorishiro of a deity ( object representative of a divine spirit ) because of their shapes .
in some regions , harvest festivals and small new year ' s festivals around january 00th involve ' kakashiage ( setting up of a scarecrow ) , ' because scarecrows are linked with a belief in yamanokami .
people in some regions also call scarecrows themselves ' tanokami . '
** in addition , the legend of shunju kyorai is believed to have a deep relation with the establishment of yashiki-gami ( family house god ) .
although yashiki-gami was established relatively recently , the divinity is believed to have a close relation with the agricultural god and sosen shin ( ancestral god ) .
there is a close relation with sorei shinko that can be pointed out .
in ancient japan , souls of the dead were believed to live in mountains .
based on this belief , therefore , many suggest that yashiki-gami may have originated from ceremony sites established in mountains or forests near homes to worship ancestors .
in ancient times , a divine spirit was generally believed not to stay in one place but to visit a specific place in a specific season and return after receiving religious services .
religious services to yashiki-gami , in general , are held mainly in spring and autumn , when such services to the agricultural god ( tanokami ) are held as explained below .
the agricultural god also came to hold an important position in sorei shinko .
in this way , the three gods--yashiki-gami , the agricultural god , and sorei-shin--had close relations with each other centering on the a god of crop soul ( toshigami ( god of the incoming year ) ) .
** by the nature of tanokami , most festival days of tanokami also concentrate in spring and autumn corresponding to the phase of cultivations .
most take the shape of agricultural rituals , mainly including the following :
** toshigami-sama ( god of the incoming year ) and preliminary celebration of new year
** minakuchi-matsuri festival
** rites and festivals of rice planting ( otaue , hanataue ) , festivals before and after rice planting
** an event of removing calamity
** rites and festivals in the harvesting season
** festivals in rice planting and reaping seasons are especially held on a large scale .
** it is widely seen in houses even today where all hanging scrolls are displayed on walls and sake and food are offered on a table to worship toshigami ( otoshi no kami ) .
some offer branches of narase-mochi ( mochibana ) ( decorating trees with rice cake ) .
** akiu no taue-odori ( the rice planting dance in akiu ) ( designated as important intangible property of folk culture ) held in akiu , sendai city , miyagi prefecture in every april today was originally a yoshuku geino held on lunar new year in the depth of winter .
** in minakuchi-matsuri festivals , tanokami is received before the cultivation season in spring and enshrined when rice nurseries are seeded .
another example in makabe-machi , ibaraki prefecture is where a pole called ' tanokami-sama ' of japanese sumac is made new years and carried to minakuchi in spring .
also in zama city , kanagawa prefecture , branches are bound like a broom at the minakuchi of a rice nursery .
the details and style of the minakuchi-matsuri festival differ from region to region .
** saori is a festival to welcome tanokami when rice planting starts．
three sheaves of young rice plants are brought from the rice nursery to be offered at an alter established at home , for example on a tokonoma ( alcove in a traditional japanese room where art or flowers are displayed ) .
saori may be called sabiraki , saike , wasaue , or sanbaioroshi depending on the region .
** sanaburi refers to a festival to send tanokami off at the end of rice planting .
it is also called sanobori or shiromite .
a shinto ritual is held by bringing young rice plants from the paddy field to offer them with sake and food to kojin ( god of a cooking stove ) or kamado-gami ( the tutelary deity of the hearth or cooking range kamado ) .
in many regions , female rice planters or those who participated in rice planting used to be invited to a banquet
although the festival is held at individual homes after the pacific war , it was once held at a landlord ' s or masters ' homes and not at individual homes .
after individual homes started to hold sanaburi , big sanaburi--events held by entire village communities , municipalities , or prefectures--came into being to show each other ' s local performing arts .
in fact , however , both big sanaburi and sanaburi at individual homes have been rarely held recently , because the sense of a community has been rapidly disappearing in today ' s rural communities .
** rice planting was the most important phase in agricultural rites .
the style of otaue still remaining today shows this work once constituted a festival
** similar events may be called hanataue in some regions .
** saotome refers to female rice planters who plant rice seedlings on the day of rice planting .
they play roles of hare and ke ( sacred-profane dichotomy ) and a secret role in serving the gods .
on this day , they wore their best clothes ( dark blue hitoe ( a single layer of kimono ) , red obi ( kimono sash ) , white tenugui ( hand towel ) , and new sedge hat ) .
such splendid clothes for rice planting mean that rice planting was a sacred , important event .
** taue-meshi refers to food eaten by people who work in rice fields on the day of rice planting .
this is sacred food eaten together with tanokami .
toshigi or pieces of firewood offered to toshigami are said to be used as fuel for cooking the food .
dressed-up females called onari carry the taue-meshi to rice fields .
the work of onari was once done by young women from the family of the field owner who were called ie-saotome or uchi-saotome .
it is believed that saotome and onari began to be differentiated , when women who planted rice began to be called saotome .
** they were linked with the star festival or folk stories of orihime , a weaving young lady of noble birth .
** hokake is an event of the first rice reaping in which a small quantity of rice ears are brought home from the field and hanged before the god to offer roasted new rice .
it is shinto rituals to offer the year ' s first rice to a god .
in western japan , it may also be called hokake of hassaku ( august 0 on lunar calendar ) .
in this case , the day of hassaku ( august 0 on lunar calendar ) becomes a festival day .
** kariage ritua , a typical event of a harvest festival , is held when rice reaping has finished .
it is also believed to be an event that is held when tanokami leaves the rice field .
formerly , niho or harvested rice ears were piled at a field side in order to worship them as a god .
sickles used in reaping work are washed for decoration , or kariage-mochi rice cake ( botamochi rice cake ) , rice balls coated with sweetened red beans , soybean flour or sesame are offered to the god .
** mikunichi refers to september 0 , 00 , and 00 ( lunar calendar ) .
it may also be called kunichi , okunchi , mikunchi and sankunichi .
a variety of events are held across japan .
in tohoku region , rice is believed to be reaped by september 00 .
in addition , the god was believed to leave for izumo province in october after eating the rice cake for kunichi .
** tokanya refers to an event of rice reaping held on october 00 ( the old lunisolar calendar ) .
children stick the ground with a bundle of straws or offer kariage-mochi rice cake to household shinto altar .
in nagano prefecture , a festival of kakashiage is held , in which a scarecrow of tokanya is brought from the paddy field to put up in the garden and a mill-stone and a square measuring cup are placed to offer rice cake .
the conical straw headpiece is removed to make a fire for baking the rice cake in some regions .
a legend where a frog carrying the offered rice cake on its back accompanies the scarecrow that ascend to heaven has been handed down in another region .
an event called daikon no toshitori is held in other regions .
** inoko is a rice reaping event held on the day of the boar in october according to the old lunisolar calendar .
the event is found in regions ranging from pacific coastal areas , west japan to southern kyushu .
in the custom , children are found walking while hitting the ground with stones and a bundle of straws or given rice cake at home .
such custom can be seen in tokanya , too .
this can be regarded as a ceremony to soothe the land in which harvesting . has finished .
** aenokoto handed down in okunoto is an event to welcome tanokami protecting rice fields and worship it by offering what is harvested .
niiname-sai festival ( ceremonial offering by the emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities ) is an event of naorai ( feast ) in which both god and people eat together .
** how tankami is shaped in details is commonly unknown .
common yorishiro ( object representative of a divine spirit ) includes branches or bundles of branches put in minakuchi , flowers , and stones .
people tend to have no permanent shido ( a hall dedicated to the deity ) nationwide .
in spite of the nationwide trend , however , it is worthy of attention that stone statues of tanokami are found only in satsuma province , osumi province , and a part of hyuga province ( miyakonojo city and its surrounding areas ) in southern kyushu .
according to the custom of these regions , stone statues called tanokansa ( tanokamisama ) carrying a wooden ladle or pestle is placed at the edge of a rice field and worshiped as a god .
nishisataura-cho , kagoshima city has an annual folklore event in spring called ' tanokami onaori , ' in which tanokami given an elaborate makeup is carried outdoor for a cherry blossom viewing party and is transferred .
** the stone statues of tanokansa are considered to have been made in and after the early 00th century .
this is supported by the fact that such stone statues were found only in the territory of shimazu clan in kagoshima domain and not in other regions .
the shape of the stones undergo the following two different lines of change :
** buddhist image type => buddhist monk type => travelling monk type
** sacred image type => shinto priest type =>dancing tanokami type ( or sacred dancing priest type )
** juro ono studied this in detail .
** however , tanokami-ko itself is found in other regions .
stones statues with carved characters of ' 田神 , ' ' 田ノ神 , ' and ' 田の神 ' are widely found by the roadside not only in southern kyushu but also across japan .
** the place-name of kitsune-zuka is commonly found across japan .
this is because the fox was once regarded as shinshi ( a divine servant ) of tanokami .
mounds ( fox mounds ) were built near rice fields and later became hokora ( a small shrine ) of inari-shin ( the god of harvest ) to appeal to the gods
this is considered to have caused the inari faith to spread nationwide .
** kazami
** hare no kazami
** ke no kazami ( informal or daily kazami )
** kazami for modern day shinto rituals
** kazami is a lightweight top ( clothing ) for girls of the noble class during the heian period .
** originally , it was worn as a garment for absorbing sweat .
however , it was used as a light outerwear in children ' s clothing but it was made into a luxury item , and it became formal clothing for girls of noble class .
** it is a luxurious outerwear used by young girls serving as attendants in ceremonial rites of the imperial court .
** it is long and its shape is the same as that of a military officer ' s outer robe called " ho " ( outer robe ) .
the collar is folded inside and worn in the tarikubi style ( wrapped in the front with a v-shaped neckline ) .
therefore , it looks like an uchigi ( ordinary kimono ) when viewed from the front .
however , the sides are not sewn together and it is worn so that the front is open at the chest .
the front is about 0 . 0 m long and the back is about 0 . 0 m long , and when worn , both trail behind like streamers of a kite .
** because the girl wearing it is underage , it is worn by layering a shorter akome ( innerwear ) for girls , unlike an uchigi for grown women .
hitoe ( a single-layer kimono ) and nagabakama ( long hakama ( divided skirt ) whose hems trail on the ground ) are purple that represents youth , instead of red .
like the sokutai ( traditional ceremonial court dress ) costume , a white outer hakama is worn over a women ' s nagabakama , which is a unique way of wearing it .
this style traces back to the days before the costume became fully adapted by the japanese imperial court , when women serving at the imperial court wore an outer hakama over the inner hakama , just as the men did .
** it seems to represent the formality of the attire for girls of noble birth when they begin to serve at the imperial court .
** this was an everyday wear worn by young girls of noble class .
because it was an everyday clothing information on it is virtually nonexistent .
however , its form is described in senmen koshakyo ( ancient hand-copied sutra on a fan ) , and a replica has been created based on that .
** the shape is almost the same as that of an uchigi , but it is a full-length outerwear , and it is worn layered with a kiribakama ( ankle-length hakama ) , hitoe and a girls ' akome .
** there is also a type that has sodekukuri ( straps used to turn up the cuffs ) .
** it developed from hare no kazami , and it is used in occasions varying from modern court functions to modern shinto rituals .
** it is a pale blue costume that looks like a long ho .
it is worn with a futa-ai ( bluish purple obtained by dyeing with both deep red and indigo blue ) shitagasane ( long inner robe ) and an outer hakama , just as in the heian period .
however , the hakama worn underneath is not a nagabakama , but a red oguchibakama ( wide-leg hakama , pleated and divided skirt made in fine stripes ) just as the men do .
shigai shoes are also worn .
** the hairstyle is not the old-fashioned taregami , because the hair would interfere with the activities .
a style called ' agemaki ' is used , in which the hair is parted and the locks of hair on the left and the right are looped and tied with red paper strings above the ears .
** marebito
** summary
** marebito is a term in orikuchiism that refers to a spiritual or deity-like being who visits from the afterworld at a specified time .
it is one of the most important key concepts in understanding shinobu orikuchi ' s system of thoughts .
it is valued in ethnology as a clue to probing the japanese people ' s concept of religion and the afterworld .
** orikuchi ' s theory of marebito took its shape in ' kokubungaku no hassei , dai sanko ' ( the origin of japanese literature , the third manuscript ) ( included in " kodai kenkyu " ( ancient studies ) ) .
according to this paper , his field work in okinawa inspired him to come up with the concept of marebito .
** he or she is said to come from beyond the sea ( coincides with niraikanai in okinawa ) .
later , with the influence of mountain worship , the belief of where marebito descends from has changed from beyond the sea to above the mountain or heavens ( tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) ) .
** kasanuimura
** yamatonookuni tama no kami , who was removed from the imperial court at the same time , was enshrined at oyamato-jinja shrine by nunaki iribime no mikoto , who was given responsibility .
** kasanuimura , according to one theory , is associated with the place of origin of daijo-sai festival ( first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned emperor ) and toyoakari no sechie ( one of the ceremonies at a seasonal holiday ) .
** hibara-jinja shrine , kasayamako-jinja shrine , obuten-jinja shrine ( in the mountains further east of kasayamako-jinja shrine ) , anashi niimasuhyozu-jinja shrine are literally in the mountains .
** furthermore , the name jinraku ( 秦楽 ) related to kasanui-jinja shrine exists in the flatland called jinraku ( 神楽 ) that spreads in front of and just below the tsukiyama kofun ( ancient tomb ) ( yamatotakada city ) ( aza tsukiyama , tsukiyama , yamatotakada city ) .
according to one theory this jinraku ( 神楽 ) was written as jinraku ( 秦楽 ) in the olden days .
it may suggest that they are related somehow .
** when yatsugikami no mikoto-jinja shrine ( also presumably yatsuki shinmei-jinja shrine : the enshrined deity is amenoakaru toyotama no mikoto ) is viewed from o-jinja shrine , it is the direction in which jinraku and tsukiyama kofun are located .
in reality , however , they cannot be seen for some unknown reason because they are hidden by ' yatsugi no mori ' ( yatsugi forest : the forest of yatsugikami no mikoto-jinja shrine ) , which has been protected with care by the local residents .
** or , it is possible that hashihaka ( kofun ) was seen from o-jinja shrine when viewed in the direction of himemiko-jinja shrine .
himemiko-jinja shrine was originally located further back ( to the north : kamiza ( upper seat , seat of honor ) ) of o-jinja shrine .
therefore , there is a possibility that it was relocated to the front ( south , shimoza ( lower seat ) ) .
** if o-jinja shrine were to be the presumed location of kasanuimura , these ancient tombs ' locations would be a mirror image , with the south and the north , and the east and the west switched .
** kasanui-jima island in osaka
a legend at fukae inari-jinja shrine ( fukae-minami , higashinari ward , osaka city ) says that fukae in the vicinity was the kasanui family ' s residence , and that the family migrated from kasanuimura in yamato .
kasanui-jima island was an island located in an inlet between the present-day fukae to ajiro , higashiosaka city .
it is believed that the kasanui family lived on the island in order to secure the materials for straw hats .
therefore , it is speculated that the original kasanuimura in yamato was either a low-lying wetland or a land shaped like an island .
** even to this day , the straw hats used at daijo-sai festival is presented to the imperial family from fukae .
moreover , fukae is said to be a region that is closely associated with a caster related to the goshinkyo mirror ( sacred mirror ) of the imperial ancestor .
there is a possibility that it is also related to kagamitsukuri-jinja shrine ( including areas around yao , tawaramoto-cho , shiki-gun ) .
** tatari-gami
** tatari-gami are shikon ( four spirits ) which are held in awe but avoided , and believed to become a powerful guardian god if treated cordially .
it is also believed that whether to receive a benefit or misfortune depends on the depth of a person ' s faith .
this is what goryo-shinko ( a folk religious belief of avenging spirits ) is about .
the faith , in general , tends to be practiced cordially and on a large scale because of the nature of the god .
many branch shrines have been established .
** the purpose of gion festival , a long-lasting festival held in heian-kyo , an ancient capital kyoto , is to pacify and give repose to tatari-gami .
its shusaijin ( main enshrined deities ) or gion shinko ( gion faith ) and gozu tenno ( deity said to be the indian god gavagriva ) is susano ( deity in japanese mythology ) , which is the typical example of tatari-gami .
gozu-tennosha shrines were built across japan , because tatari-gami was believed to be an evil god bringing epidemic but at the same time come to work as the guardian god if cordially treated .
** nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) describes that conquered gods on the earth , particularly yamata no orochi ( eight forked great serpent ) exterminated by susanoo are typical tatari-gami .
the sacred sword , ama no murakumo no tsurugi sword which came out of yamata no orochi has been enshrined as the three sacred treasures of the imperial family .
in the izumo-taisha shrine and suwa-taisha shrine , kunitsukami ( gods of the land ) believed to have once lived there have been sealed and enshrined .
( the ranking of the shrines sacred to such gods is taisha , whereas the ranking of the sacred to conqueror tenjin ( heavenly gods ) is jingu . )
** the curses of the sacred sword appear to have been considered to be extremely powerful
in the former case , nihonshoki has it that the curse was placed because the ama no murakumo no tsurugi sword stolen from atsuta-jingu shrine and lost was presented to the imperial court and stored there .
in the latter case , the curse was placed because the sword was forced to move from isonokami-jingu shrine to heian-kyo .
in the end , these sacred swords were held in reverence and returned to where they had been found .
** goryo-shinko
persons who were awed because of their unfortunate deaths , such as sugawara no michizane , the emperor sutoku , and taira no masakado have been enshrined as a god categorized into tatari-gami .

** omigoromo
** omigoromo is an outer garment used in shinto rituals that has been handed down since ancient times .
it is descended from aozuri no koromo ( blue rubbed dyed robes ) described in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and so on .
when it was worn in the jingonjiki ritual , kokoroba ( a kind of artificial flowers ) or hikagenokazura ( a specie of club moss whose formal name is lycopodium clavatum ) it was not attached to the crown .
it is called omigoromo because it was mainly worn by omi .
** the word " mi " ( 忌 ) of omi ( 小忌 ) is said to represent divine things .
** regardless of gender , it is worn over heian period costumes , and scarlet strings ( occasionally mixed with black strings ) were hung down from the right shoulder .
maibito ( dancer ) of performances , such as kagura ( sacred music and dancing performed at shrines ) , had the strings down from the left shoulder , most likely because it was less obstructive than from the right shoulder .
some have set-in sleeves , others don ' t .
** the following is the classification of omigoromo under provisions valid since the cloister government period .
** 0 . shoshi no omi
scarlet strings are attached to the right shoulder .
it is called shoshi no omi ( omigoromo for officials ) because it is granted as an imperial gift and worn by officials assigned as omi on the day of the shinsai festival .
the omi , having been granted after the arrival of the imperial palace , wore it over sokutai ( traditional ceremonial court dress ) and inserted them into the bottom hems below sekitai ( leather belt ) .
in recent times , the fabric is the linen processed with kobari ( thick coating of whitewash ) .
surimon ( pattern printed with woodblock ) of ' rindo ( gentian ) and long-tailed fowl ' or ' plum trees and willows ' , etc . are printed on the fabric .
** 0 . watakushi no omi
watakushi no omi has agekubi ( round collar ) , and the width of mi is single width ( approx . 00 inches ) , while each of the left and right sleeves have double width ( approx . 00 inches ) .
it is shaped like kariginu ( informal clothes worn by court nobles ) with a longer bottom , but there is no sodekukuri ( straps to turn up one ' s cuffs ) .
scarlet strings are attached to the right shoulder .
as an alternative to ho ( outer robe/vestment ) which is part of sokutai , it is worn over shitagasane ( long inner robe ) and hanpi ( sleeveless body wear ) .
those who are granted shoshi no omi in the shinsai festival wear it in sechie ( seasonal court banquets ) which is naorai ( feast after festival ) of the niiname-sai festival or the daijo-sai festival .
it is called watakushi no omi ( privately owned omigoromo ) because it is prepared at personal expense while shoshi no omi is an imperial grant .
in recent times , the fabric is the linen processed with kobari , and various patterns are printed with aozuri on the fabric .
** the following classification is unclear according to records from the medieval period , but it has been institutionally established in early modern times .
** 0 . nyogyo no omi ( 如形小忌 )
nyogyo no omi ( 如形小忌 ) is a sleeveless version of the shoshi no omi .
resembles the kamishimo ( an edo-period ceremonial dress of the warrior class ) .
its mi is double width ( approx 00 inches ) and has tarikubi and scarlet strings attached to the right shoulder .
it was worn mainly by jigekanjin ( lower ranking groups of officials serving the imperial court ) who served in religious services .
when it was worn as sokutai , the bottom hems were inserted below sekitai , and in other cases , the hems were just hung down without the insertion .
the fabric is comprised of linen processed with kobari , and patterns consist of mainly plum trees and willows printed with aozuri on the fabric .
** 0 . becchoku no omi
becchoku no omi was worn by court nobles called emonja who engaged in dressing the emperor with the imperial costume for shinto rituals ( gosaifuku ) .
it was also worn by kugyo ( the top court officials ) who looked after the emperor as close aides called giso ( a position conveying what the congress decides to the emperor ) .
it was called becchoku ( special imperial ordinance ) no omi because the wearers were not chosen by senjiki ( 占食 ) due to the importance of their role .
in many cases , it was worn over ikan ( traditional formal court dress ) .
in such case , the front hems were inserted into the area between the chest and kimono called ' kaikomi ' and the back hem was hung down .
the fabric is comprised of linen processed with kobari , and patterns consist mainly of running water with bracken printed together with aozuri on the fabric .
when it is worn over ikan , scarlet strings are usually not attached .
the name and the wearers , such as emonja , are based on the description in " engyo daijoe-ki " ( the diary of the retired emperor gofushimi which recorded the daijo-sai festival of his younger brother , emperor hanazono ) .
however , the details of the style were determined at the time of revival of daijo-sai festival in 0000 .
** a type worn in performance of bugaku ( traditional japanese court music accompanied by dancing ) which is accompanied by japanese ancient songs and ballads such as azuma-asobi is the same as watakushi no omi but the scarlet strings are attached to the left shoulder .
however , as the wearer is not chosen by senjiki ( 占食 ) , it is normally not called omigoromo but ' aozuri . '
gosechi no maihime/maihime at gosechi-festival also wears karaginu ( a waist length chinese style jacket ) but it is also not called omigoromo normally .
however , its characteristics could be regarded as the same as those of omigoromo in the respect that both are shinto ritual costumes that have aozuri printings .
** in the recent times , shoshi no omi is worn by gubukan ( a special monk who holds a position in the imperial court ) regardless of gender .
in this case , although the wearer is not chosen to be ' omi ' because there is no practice of senjiki ( 占食 ) , but the original name has been retained .
** it was worn by kunin ( female servants in residence at miya ) at the imperial court in the niiname-sai festival and the toyoakari no sechie and so on .
it was also worn by gosechi no maihime in the daijo-sai festival , maibito in kagura , yasedoji in taiso ( imperial mourning ) , shinto priest and miko ( a shrine maiden ) .
** * please provide evidence for the use of shoshi no omi by yasedoji .
** there is a tradition that amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) was wearing it when she reappeared from her iwadokakure ( a story of ancient japanese myth in which amaterasu hid from anger in a stone cave ) .
it is said to have its origin in this story although this is only a tradition .
** it may date back to the time when emperor sujin enshrined amaterasu omikami in kasanui no mura especially because it is worn in the toyoakari no sechie .
** when the emperor yuryaku climbed mt . katsuragi , the followers of both the emperor and hitokotonushi no kami wore the same costume that was printed with aozuri with scarlet strings attached .
it is intriguing to compare this costume with omigoromo .
** likewise , the aozuri is typically used in shrine maiden costume .
omigoromo is also used as the costume for miko kagura in recent times ( ex . urayasu no mai dance ) .
** in addition , its correlation with chihaya or hire ( scarf-like cloth draped around woman ' s neck , both ends of which are hung down frontwards at the same length ) is also interesting to note .
** omigoromo with the same name appears in kabuki ( traditional drama performed by male actors ) as an everyday cloth of the nobility .
however , it is a luxurious dress of silk with a large neckband like that of a frilled lizard .
therefore , as it is completely different from the original omigoromo , its origin is uncertain .
** kanayago-kami
** kanayago-kami god ( also pronounced as kanayako-kami god , etc . ) was a god which is believed by blacksmiths to live mainly in chugoku region ( shintoism ) .

it is said that kanayago-kami voluntary become murage ( a chief engineer in metal forging ) in various places and taught the art of metal forging there .
** kanayago-kami had the following features .
** it is said that the god hated hemp because the god or his murage subordinate stumbled over a piece of hemp and died .
it is also said that the god hated dogs and ivy because he was run after by a dog and tried to escape from the dog by climbing ivy , and the ivy snapped and the god fell and was bitten to death .
the god seemed to like mandarin orange and japanese wisteria because , when the god run after by a dog , the god climbed a mandarin orange tree or grabbed japanese wisteria and was saved .
katsura tree is a holy tree .
** it is said that the god was far from being indifferent and rather liked the chance to die , therefore , the god instructed his murage subordinates to hang down dead human bodies from the posts around the cupola furnace .
it is also said that , when the subordinates hung the dead human bodies , much iron started to be collected .
** the god hated women .
it is said that this was due to the jealousy that resulted from the god being female , and it is said that there was a rule that prohibited women from entering workplaces concerned with metal forging .
it is also said that the murage in those days , like shinobu orikuchi , did not use the same hot water to take a bath as women after the women had taken a bath .
** the above was also described in detail in " tetsuzan hisho " ( tetsuzan ' s secret book ) written by shigenaka shimohara who was a resident in miyaichi , hino county , hakuki province .
** it is believed that the words " sa " and " sahi " meant iron .
** mt . sanpei which was deeply related to nigihayahi and mononobe clan was called mt . sahiuri in ancient times .
0 km in the west from mt . sanpei in ichi no miya in iwami province , there is mononobe-jinja shrine ( in ota city ) which are said to be both sides of a coin for ishigami-jingu shrine .
** words such as " when you ask where kanayago-kami was born , the god originally born in abe-ga-mori in katsuragi " still remain in a tatara song ( which was sung when the bellows were used for metal forging ) handed down in nishi-awakura-cho , hideta-gun , okayama prefecture .

** oyatsu-hime
** summary
** " nihonshoki "
** " sendai kujihongi " ( ancient japanese history )
** oyatsu-hime , written as " 大屋都比賣神 " or " 大屋津姫命 , " is the goddess of trees in japanese mythology .
according to the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , her father is susanoo , her older brother is isotakeru , and her younger sister is tsumatsu-hime .
the district of oya-cho in ota city , shimane prefecture is named after oyatsu-hime .
** it is said that susanoo ordered her , together with isotakeru and tsumatsu-hime , to sow the seeds of trees on mountains all over the country , and after that , she went back to kii province ( present-day wakayama prefecture ) and lived there .
** she is enshrined in oyatsuhime-jinja shrine in utamori , wakayama city , wakayama prefecture .
** she is also the goddess of reproduction , because her sowing of seeds all over the country represents women ' s ability to give birth .
today , she is worshiped as the goddess of forestry and the construction industry , along with her older brother , isotakeru , and her younger sister , tsumatsu-hime .
** the fifth addendum to chapter eight in the first volume of the " nihonshoki " mentions oyatsu-hime in the following passage .
** the " chigi hongi " ( original record of earthly deities ) in chapter four of the " sendai kujihongi , " a text that appeared in the heian period but whose authenticity is disputed , mentions oyatsu-hime in the following passage .
** susanoo had a son , isotakeru and two daughters , oyatsu-hime and tsumatsu-hime . these three gods contributed to sowing seeds and growing trees all across the nation , and then they moved to kii province where they were enshrined .
** iwakura
** iwakura is one form of worship within koshintoism ( shintoism practiced prior to the introduction of confucianism and buddhism to japan ) , which worships nature ( worshipping of spirits , animism ) that has been in japan since the ancient times .
** it is a type of substratum worship of a very large boulder .
** iwasaka is considered to be another form of worship associated with boulders .
however , in contrast to iwakura , there are virtually no actual examples .
therefore , they may be considered one and the same .
in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , it is distinguished from iwakura .
** in shinto rituals the deity descended from its body , which is iwakura , onto yorishiro ( object representing a divine spirit ) ( called himorogi ) , and yorishiro and kamui ( deity ) were used as the focus of the celebration .
with time , as the main shrine , where the deity is considered to always reside , became permanently installed , the object of worship moved away from the body of the deity and changed to the shrine itself .
however , in most cases the shrine is built at the original site of worship in koshintoism from ancient times .
therefore , in many cases sacred trees and sacred spirit rocks decorated with shimenawa ( sacred rice-straw ropes ) are used as yorishiro , and they remain as they are within the grounds of the shrines .
** hobei
** hobei ( hohei ) means to offer heihaku ( paper , silk cuttings or red and white cloth presented to deities ) to shrines and the imperial mausoleums by the emperor ' s command .
the emperor may visit the site himself to pray and offer the heihaku himself .
however , often times hobei is done by sending the emperor ' s messenger or imperial envoy .
this messenger or envoy is called hobeishi .
** engishiki jinmyocho ( a register of shrines in japan ) records a list of shrines worthy of receiving hobei , and 0000 of them are recorded .
** the hobeishi had to be someone of a court rank higher than goi ( fifth rank ) as well as a person of the deity ' s will in accordance with bokusen ( divination ) .
furthermore , for some shrines the hobeishi was already predetermined .
there was a rule that the members from the o clan ( the shirakawa family ) served at ise-jingu shrine , the members from the wake clan served at usa-jingu shrine and the members of the fujiwara clan served at kasuga-taisha shrine .
normally , hobeishi was accompanied by a senmyoshi ( a messenger of imperial edict ) , and after the hobei ritual the senmyoshi read the imperial edict .
** after the medieval ages , the hobei ritual at kanname-sai festival held at ise-jingu shrine was given the special name of reihei .
the hobeishi serving at the reihei ritual was called reiheishi ( or ise reiheishi , to distinguish from nikko reiheishi mentioned later ) .
occasional hobei rituals for reporting to ise-jingu shrine the dates of the emperor ' s enthronement , daijo-sai festival and genpuku ritual ( celebration of one ' s coming of age ) is called yoshinohobei .
** the edo period
with the decline of the imperial court the ritual was gradually reduced and lost substance .
after the onin war , no more hobei rituals were performed except for the ones at ise-jingu shrine .
from the mid-00th century the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) began to place a high esteem on the ceremonies of the imperial court .
in 0000 , the hobei ritual was revived for the first time in 000 years at 00 shrines belonging to the seven upper shrines .
the nikko reiheishi system , in which the messengers were sent to the reisai ( regular festivals ) at nikko tosho-gu shrine , began in 0000 .
during the edo period , the mere mention of reiheishi often referred to nikko reiheishi .
** going to nikko at the time was a tremendous ' trip to the countryside ' to a nikko reiheishi , and therefore , there was a desire to finish the hobei ritual as soon as possible and return home .
furthermore , having to go via edo during the trip meant many troublesome issues such as visiting the bakufu .
therefore , reiheishi took the inland route of nakasendo road - kuraga no shuku post station - reiheishi kaido road for the trip to nikko , without going through the tokaido road and edo .
** nikko reiheishi
nikko reiheishi was normally a low-ranking , poor court noble .
however , they held a tremendous influence during the trip because they bore the authority of the imperial court and the bakufu .
because the trip was a government service , post stations and sukego-mura villages ( government assigned villages along frequently-traveled roads that provided inns and resources for travelers ) were made to contribute their support for free , which caused them a tremendous inconvenience .
the following stories have been passed down .
** when the palanquin shook even a little bit the rider jumped out of the palanquin and insisted by saying " i fell off the palanquin because of the improper pace of the palanquin carriers , i will report this insolence to the bakufu . "
then he wrangled compensation from the people of the post station and the palanquin carriers to settle the dispute .
** the reiheishi brought large amounts of empty nagamochi ( trunks ) and made requests such as six carriers ( carried by six people ) or eight carriers ( carried by eight people ) .
furthermore , he insisted on having a number of carriers far beyond what the post station could provide .
this was done so in order to wrangle money from the post station to compensate for the insufficient number of carriers ( the reiheishi supposedly had to hire carriers himself ) .
needless to say , the people at the post station were also shrewd , and haggling over price reduction often took place .

after taking it home and putting it near her bed , she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy .

** kogakusho , kangakusho
** kogakusho ( the imperial learning place ) and kangakusho ( the chinese learning place ) were higher educational institutions established in kyoto by the meiji government immediately after the restoration of imperial rule .
they aimed to be alternative institutions for daigaku-ryo ( bureau of education under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) ) but ended in failure .
** summery
in the late heian period , when the great fire of angen occurred , daigaku-ryo was virtually abolished .
after that time , imperial court didn ' t have official educational institutions .
in 0000 , emperor ninko set up gakushuin in kyoto imperial place for the purpose of re-establishing educational institutions .
** due to political turbulence during taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) , gakushuin was closed down for a half year but resumed on april 0 , 0000 .
** previously , three scholars of japanese classical literature : atsutane hirata , misao tamamatsu , harumichi yano were required to do a research about the new school system .
the report was submitted on april 00 .
they tried to make the system with honkyo-gaku , which was centered on kokugaku , instead of the confucianism-centered myogyo-do .
** however , on may 0 , mainly conservative court nobles who objected the initiative hammered out daigaku-ryo re-establishment line and changed the name of gakushuin to daigakuryo-dai .
hirata and others strongly dissented .
akimichi hasegawa was troubled and he sent tomomi iwakura a written opinion to encourage compromise between both sides
iwakura agreed and on october 00 , he made a transition to two educational institutions system : the kokugaku-centered " kogakusho " based on hirata opinion and the kangaku-centered " kangakusho " ( kangaku is the study of chinese classical literature ) , which was reorganization of daigakuryo-dai .
** however , when the capital city was immediately transferred kyoto to tokyo , the initiative of the government in tokyo shifted to establish " daigaku " based on shohei-gakko school from the old edo shogunate , incorporating western studies .
as a result , on october 0 , 0000 , the government gave an order to abolish kogakusho and kangakusho after which both were abolished in eight days .
** however , both kogakusho and kangakusho strongly made an objection to the resolution .
however , it was abolished on orders of the government in august , 0000 .

** location
** god of the hearth
** god of the hearth ( kamado-gami ) in japan
** the god of the hearth is enshrined at hearths , irori ( traditional japanese open hearths ) and other places where fire is used .
** kamado-gami is the god of fire and , at the same time , the guardian god of agriculture , livestock , and family .
** in the shinetsu region , two wooden dolls about 00cm long called kamagami is the " shintai " ( object of worship ) , while a doll-like paper gohei is worshiped in kagoshima prefecture .
in some regions , he is enshrined in gohei or talismans kept on a pillar or shelf near the kamado ; in others , a gotoku ( metal stand ) or other implements used in an irori is regarded as the shintai .
** the statue of sanpokojin , a japanese buddhist deity , is also known for being worshiped as kamado-gami .
because this is a god who values cleanliness and eliminates impurities , he is considered to be linked to the god of fire .
in the kinki and chugoku regions , doku-shin ( also pronounced doko-jin ) , a god of onmyodo ( the way of yin and yang ; an occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements ) , is worshiped as kamado-gami .
it is thought that the god moves from one place to another depending on the season : the kamado in spring , the gate in summer , the well in fall , and the garden in winter .
in residences , the area containing the kamado has the image of being darker than zashiki ( japanese style tatami rooms ) .
** it is also said that kamado-gami is a very intense god .
there is a legend that those who treat this god improperly will receive divine punishment and that climbing on the kamado will make the god angry .
** izanami
** episodes from mythology
** origin of the name
** burial site
** izanami ( written as 伊弉冉 , 伊邪那美 , 伊弉弥 ) is a goddess in japanese mythology .
because she is described as ' imoto ( literally ' younger sister ' ) izanami ' in some documents , she may be misinterpreted as a younger sister of izanagi .
however , in this case , ' imoto ' affectionately referred to a wife or girl younger than oneself .
it does not mean younger sister here .
she was the wife of izanagi .
she is also known as yomotsu okami and chishiki no okami .
** in the creation of heaven and earth , izanami and izanagi were the last generation of kaminoyonanayo ( seven generations of gods ) .
izanami and izanagi had a lot of children who formed the land of japan .
they created the japanese islands starting with awaji-shima island and oki no shima island , and then created the various gods of nature , including the mountain god and sea god .
when izanami gave birth to kagutsuchi ( the god of fire ) , she burned her genitalia , got sick , and eventually died .
** even after her death , gods were created from her urine , faeces and vomit .
** izanagi went to yominokuni ( the realm of the dead ) to see izanami but when he saw her decomposed body , izanami was ashamed and chased izanagi , who had fled in terror .
however , izanagi blocked the road at the yomotsu hirasaka , the slope that forms the border between the land of the dead and the world above , so that they would not see each other again .
then , izanami and izanagi got divorced .
** after that , izanami became the ruling goddess of yominokuni , and was called yomotsu okami or chishiki no okami .
** the ' izana ' part of her name comes from ' izanau ' ( invite ) , and ' mi ' signifies a female .
there is also another theory that izanami ( ' nami ' means wave ) and izanagi ( ' nagi ' means lull ) are paired .
one of her other names , yomotsu okami , means the deity presiding over yominokuni .
chishiki no okami means the god who caught up with izanagi at yomotsu hirasaka .
the name yomotsu okami implies one who controls death and war .
in terms of comparative mythology , yomotsu okami is related to the hainuwele myth of seram , indonesia .
** mausoleums , shrines
there is a theory that the place name izumo ( 出雲 ) is derived from izumo ( 稜威母 ) , which was the eulogistic name of izanami , mother god of japan .
hoki province , adjacent to the eastern part of izumo province , was called hahaki ( which mean ' mother ' s port ' ) in ancient times .
in the edo period , the area where the izumo mausoleum of the gods is located ( hakuta-cho , yasugi city , shimane prefecture ) was known as mori domain ( written with characters meaning ' mother ' s village ' ) , a sub-domain of matsue domain .
there is an anecdote in " izumo no kuni fudoki " ( records of the culture and geography of izumo province ) that yasugi-go , ou-gun was named by izanami ' s son , susanoo .
the sacred site of yomotsu hirasaka , where izanagi left izanami for good , is located near iya-jinja shrine in higashi-izumo-cho , yatsuka-gun next to yasugi city .
** izanami is worshipped as the goddess who created all things in the universe , the creator , the sea goddess , and the goddess of iron making .
other than the above-described sacred sites , shrines where izanami is enshrined include the following :
** izanagi-jingu shrine ( awaji city , hyogo prefecture )
** taga taisha shrine ( taga-cho , inugami-gun , shiga prefecture )
** tsukiyominomiya , located in kotai-jingu betsugu ( ise city , mie prefecture )
** hananoiwaya-jinja shrine ( kumano city , mie prefecture )
** mitsumine-jinja shrine ( chichibu city , saitama prefecture )
** tsukubasan-jinja shrine ( tsukuba city , ibaraki prefecture )
** kumano-jinja shrine ( kamezaki , yotsukaido city ) ( yotsukaido city , chiba prefecture )
** kumano taisha shrine ( matsue city , shimane prefecture )
** kamosu-jinja shrine ( matsue city , shimane prefecture )
** yamasa-jinja shrine ( yasuki city , shimane prefecture )
** iya-jinja shrine ( higashi-izumo-cho , shimane prefecture )
** sada-jinja shrine ( matsue city , shimane prefecture )
** besides hibanoyama mountain and arima , kumano city which are described in nihonshoki , there are numerous places throughout japan where izanami is said to be buried , especially around the border between izumo and hoki .
the ministry of the imperial household recognized mt . kanna in yakumo-mura ( present-day matsue city in shimane prefecture ) as a ' referable mausoleum , ' assuming it to be the most-likely site .
the former ministry of home affairs ( japan ) designated mt . mihaka located in the north of mt . sentsu as a ' place said to be the legendary mausoleum of izanami no mikoto . '
recently , biten yasumoto , by comparing these theories in terms of philology , has identified it as the one in yasugi which is the closest to the border between shimane and tottori prefectures .

** in addition , shinboku refers to a tree which is in a site owned by a shrine or a private land and which has a special history such as an oral tradition .
shinboku sometimes refers to trees which are grown by forestation , have naturally grown and which are specially cut down to be used for building a shrine .
** throughout the several thousand year history of koshinto , forms and styles for shrines as containers and for festival rites as inner substance were established independently or under the influence of foreign religions , and these were further established as jinja ( shrine ) shinto , etc .
** kamiyorigi , kanijnboku , etc . , are specially treated as yorishiro of a god and are decorated with shimenawa ( a holy straw rope ) .
shinboku is treated as an object of worship in shiniki where there are no shrine buildings .
nagi trees , mochinoki tree and cedars are often treated as shinboku .
** in addition , in some cases , trees which are considered special in addition to yorishiro in order to maintain the scenery or make an solemn atmosphere such as jingu cedars in the ise-jingu shrine are treated as shinboku .
for those who work in mountains , conspicuous trees are temporarily treated as shinboku and deified as yorishiro of mountain gods .
** although gohei which is used in rites of jinja shinto and which is made of sakaki tree branches or nagi tree branches is also called himorogi , gohei is originally a simplified yorishiro as a substitute of naturally-grown shinboku in koshinto .
** himorogi in koshinto considered shiniki as a place for a god to stay , or a border to the other world and this world , and was feared and respected .
shimenawa ( a decorated straw rope ) is put around himorogi as kekkai to prevent people or things in this world , gods in the other world , or those that invite misfortunes and mishaps for this world from easily coming over and go across , making himorogi off-limits .
at present , in many places , not only shrines , shinboku , and shrine forests but entire islands are considered to be off-limits , such as okino-shima island .
in some places , a specific time period to invite happiness is provided and rites and festivals to cancel kekkai of shinboku and to invite gods are held .
** shinboku refers to a tree which has a special episode such as an old tale .
in addition , a tree such as one which is featured in a waka poem by a famous tanka poet is treated as shinboku .
many trees are treated as shinboku that are featured in waka poems by tanka poet such as the japanese plum tree in dazaifu-tenmangu shrine .
** a tree which was donated by a person who is related to a shrine , etc . , for some reason has been considered holy and treated as shinboku .

** yudate-kagura is also called ' yu-kagura ' .
** summary
among them , one form also exists in which rice and holy rice wine are put in hot water in a large pot ( jonan-gu shrine in kyoto city , kyoto prefecture , etc . ) .
** in some of the shrines along seashores , sea water is used instead of the hot water in a large pot ( yonsha-jinja shrine in yokoshibahikari-cho , chiba prefecture , etc . ) .
** in any of these rites , it is believed that a person who has received the splashed hot water ( or its drips ) shall suffer no disease and become healthy .
** it is said that a person who has drunk the hot water shall suffer no disease and become healthy in some shrines and , therefore , some shrines allow visitors to bring the hot water in their bottles ( ikedai-jinja shrine in tenryu-mura , nagano prefecture , etc . )
** goryu-shinto
** goryu-shinto is the ho-ryu school ( school by a priestly imperial prince ) of shinto handed down among people such as hosshinno ( imperial princes who became buddhism priests ) .
goryu-shinto is developed from ryobu shinto ( a fusion of shinto and shingon sect of buddhism ) by being closely combined with shingon esoteric buddhism .
** although goryu-shinto was dissolved under the order to separate shintoism and buddhism from each other in the meiji restoration , traces of inshin and koketsu of goryu-shinto still remain in esoteric buddhism temples at present .
** seoritsu-hime
** seoritsu hime is a shrine of haraedo no okami ( gods of purification in shinto religion ) .
seoritsu-hime is written as 瀬織津姫 , 瀬織津媛 , and 瀬織津比売 .
** she is the god of purification as well as the god of water and rain , and plays the role of washing impurities down rivers and the sea .
** atsutane hirata , a scholar of japanese classical literature and a shintoist who lived in the edo period , stated that seoritsu hime is also the same god as omagatsuhi no kami and oyabiko no kami .
seoritsu-hime is sometimes regarded as aramitama ( fierce and valiant divine spirit ) of amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) .
** in the hashihime-jinja shrine in uji city , seoritsu-hime is syncretized with ( regarded as the same as ) hashi-hime ( the protective deity of the bridge ) .
** in hotsumatsutae ( an ancient record of japan ) , seoritsu-hime appears as a legal wife of amaterasu omikami , who is a male god .
it is also considered that the recognition of amaterasu omikami as a female god is actually the result of seoritsu-hime being deleted and its syncretization with amaterasu omikami .
** during the imperial reign of fujiwara no fuhito , or emperor jito , change in shake ( family of shinto priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis ) suddenly took place at ise-jingu shrine .
what can be assumed here is the possibility that the deity enshrined in the inner shrine of ise was changed .
in the ise shinto , or a school of shinto thought established by watarai clan who were the shinto priests for the outer shrine and were prosperous during the kamakura period , it became clear that seoritsu-hime was the god of the aramatsuri-no-miya shrine of the inner shrine .
however , if this viewpoint were true , then the intention of watarai clan asserting that aramitama of amaterasu omikami , the deity enshrined in the aramatsuri-no-miya shrine of the inner shrine , is seoritsu-hime , becomes completely unexplainable .
that the enshrined deity was changed , and that the shrine visit by successive emperors was virtually prohibited , occurring simultaneously suggests that the two events are greatly related .
it can also be considered that shikinai-sha ( shrine listed in engishiki ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) ) was established in order to manage the deletion of seoritsu-hime .
** seoritsu-hime ' s gender is completely unclear in kojiki ; nihonshoki contains a single part mentioning her as a female god .
** in this area , it is gradually becoming clear that the shrines for worshipping amaterasu omikami and the relevant land , and the shrines for worshipping seoritsu-hime are intentionally located in relation to one another .
** from around 0000 , seoritsu-hime suddenly began to attract much attention .
scholars such as nobuaki kikuchi and haruo yamamizu , a musician , are actively working on the research of seoritsu-hime .
** shrines in which seoritsu-hime is the enshrined deity
seoritsuhime-jinja shrine ( kanazawa city )
shimogamo-jinja inoue-sha shrine ( kyoto city )
hashihime-jinja shrine ( uji city )
** other than the above , seoritsu-hime is worshipped in shrines of approximately five hundred places nationwide .
** muto-shin
** muto-shin is a deity which appears in somin shorai setsuwa ( anecdotes of japanese old stories ) .
he is also called mutafu no kami or muto tenjin .
** mutafu no kami was a deity of hokkai ( northern provinces ) , and when he visited nankai ( southern provinces ) to look for a wife , he said : ' i am a deity called susanoo . '
he is therefore regarded as the same as susanoo ( a deity in japanese mythology ) .
** it is considered that " muto " is not a pronoun but refers to a deity enshrined in a sanctum of trapezoidal shape called " mutan " in korea .
** in korea , there is a shaman-like presence called " mudang " ( written as 巫堂 ) .
in china , there is a word " mudan " ( written as 牡丹 ) .
** also , one theory has it that muto-shin is related to takuto-tenno , a deity of taoism syncretized with bishamonten by risei , li jing ( 000 - 000 ) , a warlord in tang dynasty .
** the anecdote of muto-shin in " bingo no kuni fudoki itsubun " later expanded into " gion gozu-tenno engi , " a narrative of gozu-tenno ( a deity said to be the indian god , gavagriva ) .
** gozu-tenno became the daio ( " great king " ) of rajagrha , magadh .
** it is written in " irohajirui-sho " ( a dictionary written by tadakane tachibana in the heian period ) as follows .
there was a place called kissho-en in the kuso-koku country in the northern part of tenjiku ( india ) , and gozo-tenno , also known as muto tenjin , was the daio of a castle there ' .
it was written that muto-shin had hachioji ( eight princes of muto-shin ) and 00 , 000 kenzokushin ( ancillary deities ) .
** kuso-koku country ' ( written as 九相国 ) is sometimes written as 倶相国 , 吉相国 , 豊饒国 , etc . , but they all mean the same thing .
** mihashira-torii
** mihashira-torii ( literally , three-column shrine gate ) is formed by coupling three torii ( shrine gate ) .
because adjacent two trii share columns , the columns are not six but three .
mihashira-torii such as the one in kijima-jinja shrine ( kaiko-no-yashiro ( literally , silkworm shrine ) in kyoto city in kyoto prefecture ) is famous .
** the style of torii of mihashira-torii is shinmei-torii and , therefore , nuki ( a lateral bar joining columns ) is only set in the inner space of columns .
** main mihashira-torii
** kijima-jinja shrine
kijima-jinja shrine is a shrine located in uzumasa in ukyo ward , kyoto city .
mihashira-torii made of stone stands in ' mototadasu-no-ike pond ' in the precincts of the shrine .
** although the current mihashira-torii is the one which was constructed in 0000 after the original one , the one depicted in ' sansai-torii ' which is the 00th volume of ' hokusai manga ' ( a collection of hokusai katsushika ' s sketches ) is made of wood .
** mikakoi-jinja shrine
mikakoi-jinja shrine is a shrine located in mukojima ( sumida ward ) in sumida ward , tokyo .

** this mihashira-torii is worshipped as the guardian god of the mitsui family and it is written on the shrine that ' a triangular stone torii . moved from the mitsui house . the original is located in kijima-jinja shrine in uzumasa in kyoto . '
** yamato-cho in gifu prefecture
mihashira-torii located in yamato-cho ( gifu prefecture ) is at a place at an altitude of about 0 , 000 m .
the mihashira-torii is about two kilometers away from a road on which cars can run .
** the mountain trails are not clear and , therefore , it is very difficult to reach the mihashira-torii .
** there is only the mihashira-torii but no shrine .
returning to a woodland path leads you to hakusan-jinja shrine .
** tsukinami-no-matsuri
** tsukinami-no-matsuri ( literally , monthly festival ) is a festival in shinto .
in ise-jingu shrine , tsukinami-no-matsuri held in june and december and kanname-no-matsuri ( kanname-sai festival ) are called sansetsu-sai festival or sanji-sai festival .
** history
in the old days , tsukinami-no-matsuri seemed to be held monthly , however , it was determined in the " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) to hold tsukinami-no-matsuri on 00th day of june and december .
tsukinami-no-matsuri is held in the imperial court and ise-jingu shrine and , on the morning of 00th day , heihaku ( silk as a gift ) was provided from the imperial court to 000 gods worshipped in kinai area ( hanhei ) .
later on , ise-jingu shrine only conducted hanhei and , when the muromachi period started , hanhei was abolished due to onin war , etc . , however , hanhei was revived in the meiji period .
currently , many shrines throughout japan determine a specific day of the month and conduct tsukinami-no-matsuri on that day .

** amabe-shi keizu
** hon-keizu ( main family tree )
hon-keizu is regarded as a precious historical document that communicates the form of ancient genealogical charts in the clearest way thanks to its adoption of a family-tree-style description .
it is considered that the hon-keizu was drawn up by inao amabe-no-atai , then the 00rd head of the amabe family ( hereinafter , the sequence number of family heads corresponds to the number described in kanchu-keizu ) .
** contents
the hon-keizu is a very simple family tree featuring amenohoakari , the founder ( deity ) of the family , and only subsequent family heads and their direct descendants until deno the 00nd , with its contents being roughly divided into the following three parts .
** the first part represents the earliest generations from the founding father to kenshinkuma no sukune , the 00th family head ; all of them had no kabane ( hereditary titles ) .
in this section , the name of only three persons ( deities ) are printed because the second and third family heads and the family heads between the fifth and eighteenth were not recorded .
** kanchu-keizu ( genealogical records based on surveys )
kanchu-keizu supplements the hon-keizu with detailed footnotes while maintaining a family-tree-style .
the other side of kanchu-keizu features shihai monjo ( an old document which was written on the other side of a piece of used paper ) depicts augury based on the weather and the shape of clouds , which is considered to date back to the momoyama period .
in fact , the kanchu-keizu was transcribed into the other side of the sheet featuring augury charts , which was used paper in nature ( these augury charts are also regarded as a valuable historical document ) .
incidentally , the note titled ' ipponden ' ( an anecdote ) in the kanchu-keizu states that the kanchu-keizu was compiled and completed as follows :
** contents
the kanchu-keizu features a family tree from the founding father to the 00th family head with detailed footnotes about the episodes and achievements of each deity and person , and some part shows family head ' s brothers and their descendants as collateral lines .
** amenonaemasu no mikoto
** amenonaemasu no mikoto ( spelled ' 天苗加命 , ' or alternatively ' 天苗益命 ' ) is a deity ( shinto ) in japanese mythology .
he is also known as asahiko no mikoto .
** it is said that amenonaemasu no mikoto is the brother or son of futsunushi no kami , who is famous for the legend of kuniyuzuri ( transfer of the land , or the pacification of ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the central land of reed plains ) ) .
** higashiyama-tenno ( takanaga ) kensho-no-kanro
** kisagaihime and umugihime
** summary
** descriptions in the mythology
** enshrined shrines
** kisagaihime and umugihime were gods ( shinto religion ) that appear in japanese mythology .
** it was considered that kisagaihime was created by deifying an arch shell , and umugihime was created by deifying a clam .
** " kojiki "
kisagaihime collected scraped powder ( ' kisagi atsume ' ) and umugihime received it and applied mother ' s milk , then okuninushi was resuscitated .
** in the description , there was a theory that it described a folk remedy to be used for burn injuries by powderizing the husk of an arch shell and mixing it with the white juice of a clam as milk .
in addition , a clam was described as ' umuki no kahi ' in " wamyo-sho " ( a dictionary compiled in the heian period ) and used as medication through the ages .
** it was certain that kisagaihime was aroused by ' kisage atsume , ' but it was not told how she was related to this narrative and umugihime other than this point .
therefore , one theory said it sounded the tone of ' kaso ' that was the ancient word of ' father ' to ' kisa ' of kisagaihime and made her appear against ' umu omo ' ( mother ) of umugihime .
** " izumo no kuni fudoki "
they appeared separately and the relationship other than they were mikogami of kamumusubi no mikoto was not clearly stated .
** both gods are enshrined in sessha amasaki no yashiro ( auxiliary shrine of inochihime-jinja shrine ) of izumo-taisha shrine .
both gods are also enshrined in kisa-jinja shrine ( nishi ward , hamamatsu city , shizuoka prefecture ) .
as for the shrines that enshrine each god , there is kaka-jinja shrine ( shimane-cho , matsue city , shimane prefecture ) for kisagaihime no mikoto and hokki-jinja shrine ( hokki-cho matsue city , shimane prefecture ) for umugihime no mikoto .
** ujisha
** summary
** ujisha is a shrine in which ujigami ( ancestors of a family who were worshiped as a god ) was worshipped .
** however , in those days , a god worshipped by ujigami was not always the original member of the clan , and the element of belief concerning the land and occupations was stronger than the element concerning the blood relations .
** at the start of the eighth century when the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) was established , the clan system itself gradually changed .
the powerful families in kinai area were given official ranks in kyoto and were separated from their original territories .
grouping by original line based on the paternal line through a hidden ranking system , etc . , was advanced , and ujigami as a guardian god of those who were from the same ancestors through their paternal lines and ujisha which worshipped this ujigami was established .
all of these families were clans that were established or developed under the ritsuryo system and , in these families , formation of groups by paternal line was actively deployed .
** this developed into a relation between ujigami and ujiko ( supporters of ujigami ) that can be seen today .
** amenokaguyama no mikoto
** major shrines where amenokaguyama no mikoto was enshrined
** amenokaguyama no mikoto was the japanese god ( shinto religion ) .
it was sometimes written as ' 天香語山命 ' or ' 天賀吾山命 , ' so it could also read ' ame ( ma ) nokagoyama no mikoto . '
** he was soshin ( ancestor honored as god ) of owari clan and was the half brother god of umashimaji no mikoto who was soshin of mononobe clan .
** in ' tenjin hongi ' ( the original record of the heavenly deity ) of " kujihongi , " he was counted as one of thirty two gods who obeyed tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) by nigihayahi no mikoto .
** also , in the biography of iyahiko-jinja shrine in niigata prefecture , it described that he was engaged in subjugation and reclamation of koshi province by receiving the imperial order after emperor jinmu subjugated yamato province ( see iyahiko-jinja shrine for details ) .
** iyahiko-jinja shrine
uonuma-jinja shrine
** nagashiraha no kami
** nagashiraha no kami was a god appearing in iwato-gakure ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , in the heavenly rock cave ) of kogo-shui ( history of the inbe clan ) .
by omoikane ( the god of wisdom and talent ) ' s order , he raised hemp and weaved aonigite ( blue fabric to hang on a branch of sakaki to put it on the altar ) .
** he was dozokushin ( god of the same family ) of futodama .
another name was amenoshiraha no kami , and one theory said nagashiraha no kami derived from tenpaku shinko ( folk religion in the east half of japan ) .
he was enshrined as the enshrined deity of amenoshiraha-jinja shrine stated in engishiki jinmyocho ( a register of shrines in japan ) of kuji county , hitachi province ( present hitachi-ota city , ibaraki prefecture ) .
** tahirikishimarumi no kami
** tahirikishimarumi no kami was a god ( shinto religion ) who appeared in japanese mythology .
** he was appeared as the fifth grandchild god in the genealogy of okuninushi no kami in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , but nothing but the god ' s name was stated , so the name was also unknown .
** fukuden
** fukuden is a deity bringing happiness in folk beliefs in japan .
also called fuku no kami or fukujin .
although it is sometimes considered that it is a deity and called fukujin or fuku no kami in shinto , and it is one of the tenbu ( group of protectors of buddhist laws ) and called fukuden in buddhism , there is no strict distinction .
** " binbo gami ( deity of poverty ) and fuku no kami ( or fuku no kami and binbo gami ) " in old tales have different stories , but fuku no kami and binbo gami appear as deities in a pair .
it is also said that fuku no kami is the older sister and called kisshoten , and binbo gami is the younger sister and called kokuanten ( these two tenbu deities are also sisters in buddhism ) .
there is a variation that binbo gami transforms into fuku no kami when treated cordially , and " nihon eitaigura " ( the eternal storehouse of japan ) by saikaku ihara has a story based on this .
** it may also refer to shichifukujin ( seven deities of good luck ) or one of them .
** in " fukunokami " of kyogen ( farce played during a noh play cycle ) , fukuden appears at a shrine , and holds a drinking party with ninen-mairi ( a two year visit to a shrine , dec . 00st to january 0st ) worshippers .
** miyaza
** summary
** history
** miyaza is the empowered group in a village or its qualified members engaged in rituals of a shrine , a guardian god or a local deity of a village .
as it had no full-time shinto priest , members of miyaza took the role of shinto priest on a yearly rotation , which was called the toya system ( a person- or family-on-duty system ) .
** miyaza roughly consisted of two groups : kabuza ( a closed group ) and muraza ( an open group ) .
according to one popular theory , kabuza was established first , and then liberated to become muraza ; the opposite view is that muraza was terminated by stratification and became kabuza .
miyaza having a multilayered structure in which kabuza coexisted with muraza was also found in and around the capital .
there were two ways to assume the post of shinto priest who performed rituals ; ichiro took the position ; members of otona did on a yearly rotation ( ichinen kannushi , nenban kannushi ) .
toya or tonin ( heads ) who had the responsibility for the preparation of rituals was decided in order of age , family status , or admittance to miyaza and by drawing lots ( sometimes , shinto priest served concurrently as toya ) .
the role of toya was generally performed by one family ; however , related families or neighbors occasionally helped it ; the former was called honto , and the latter were called wakito , or sukekashira .
miyaza also held forest lands , whose profits were used for its operation .
** after the war , the academic research on miyaza developed rapidly .
the prominent researchers are kazuo higo , takeshi toyoda , toshiaki harada , narimitsu matsudaira , tatsuo hagiwara , seiichi ando , and toshiki sonobe .
** it is very difficult to clarify the origin of miyaza ; one theory holds that miyaza was related to the establishment of za , a type of monopolistic trade association of medieval japan .
the most convincing theory is that miyaza originated in the banyaku or toyaku system in the late heian period ( the 00th century ) in which a lord of the manor or a officer governing manors allotted the roles of ritual services to powerful local figures .
** in the edo period , murakiri ( defining boundaries of a village ) was conducted under the shogunate system , and the honbyakusho ( a freeholding farmer ) system was established ; miyaza ( zakata ) and the village administration ( murakata ) were operated separately .
as the roji system weakened , the group ' s hierarchy was permanently determined by family status .
however , with its rebound , when the honbyakusho system was abolished in the late edo period , a series of disputes broke out : zanami disputes concerning the positions within miyaza and kanyu disputes concerning membership for villagers who were excluded from miyaza .
in the following meiji government , the separation of buddhism and shintoism , land-tax reform , and the introduction of state-shintoism transformed the structure of miyaza ; the postwar democratization and agrarian reform gave an additional blow .
the most severe blows were the urbanization during the high economic growth period as well as the progress of the depopulation and aging in rural areas .
** mitsutorii
** mitsutorii is a combination of three myojin-gate torii ( a pillared gate-like entrance to a shinto shrine ) , and it is sometimes called yotsuashi torii ( four-legged torii ) because it has four pillars .
** major mitsutorii
** omiwa-jinja shrine
although the mitsutorii in omiwa-jinja shrine cannot be actually seen because it is in the prohibited area , the official website of omiwa-jinja shrine has the picture of the model of mitsutorii in ' precincts guide - mitsutorii . '
the official website of omiwa-jinja shrine doesn ' t mention the period when the mitsutorii was formed or its derivation .
** mitsumine-jinja shrine
** there is mitsutorii in front of the haiden ( a hall of worship ) of mitsumine-jinja shrine .
** it is also unclear about the derivation of mitsutorii of mitsumine-jinja shrine .

** simple way of behaving at a shrine
** attention
** shinto ( or kannagara no michi ) is an ethnical religious framework in japan and a polytheistic religion that is unique to japan .
** shinto is a religion originating in particular cultural traditions that have been believed since ancient japan .
shinto is based on traditional ethnic and natural beliefs that naturally generated and grew among ethnic groups living in japan and has been gradually growing in conjunction with central and local systems of politics carried out by groups of local ruling families .
** the type of virtue practiced in shinto religion is jyomyoseichoku ( clean and clear , cheerful , honest , and straightforward ) .
** shinto is supported by approximately 00 million people in japan ( agency for cultural affairs ' " shukyo nenkan " ) and there are approximately 00 , 000 recorded shrines .
** the following are denominations of shinto religion
imperial house shinto
it is shinto for the imperial court ; that is , the imperial family , centered on the three shrines in the imperial palace .
** shrine shinto
this is a type of belief putting an emphasis on the implementation of religious services and ceremonies , mainly by shrines and other organs consisting of ujiko ( shrine parishioners ) and revering persons .
** sect shinto ( the 00 shinto sects )
a religion based on religious experiences of a founder or originator of the sect .
sect shinto is slightly different in character from other shinto religions .
** koshinto ( as practiced prior to the introduction of confucianism and buddhism to japan )
after the meiji period , only koshinto was separated and established as a new religion , so it can be classified as fukko shinto ( returning to the ancient shinto . )
** nowadays , when speaking of ' shrine shinto ' alone , it means shrine shinto .
** also , based on the things emphasized , it is classified as :
shajin shinto ( 社人神道 ) - centering on ceremonies
school sect shinto - centering on education and learning .
** particularly , ' state shinto ' was a name of a denomination of shinto religion which was supported by the state in japan from the restoration of imperial rule of 0000 ( japan ) to the end of world war ii .
as a result of separation of government and religion , the meaning of the word ' shrine ' has changed and there is really very little chance to simply call state shinto ' shrine . '
in addition , there is a misleading opinion that ghq ( general headquarters of the allied forces ) fabricated the tradition or story of state shinto .
** furthermore , shinto can also be classified as follows :
** festival-type shinto
imperial house shinto - religious services in imperial court
shrine shinto - common religious services in shrines
koshinto - doso-shin ( traveler ' s guardian deity ) , tanokami ( deity of rice fields and harvests , ) mountain kami ( god ) and kamadogami ( the tutelary deity of the hearth ) , etc .
onmyodo line ( way of yin and yang ; occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements ) - tsuchimikado shinto ( shinto of tsuchimikado school ) and izanagi-ryu , etc .
teaching-type shinto
school sect shinto
fukko shinto ( reform shinto ( prominent 00th century form of shinto , based on the classics , and free from confucian and buddhist influences ) ) - atsutane hirata , etc .
theory shinto - ise shinto and yuiitsu shinto ( one-and-only shinto ) , etc .
syncretism of shinto and buddhism - ryobu shinto ( a fusion of shinto and the shingon sect of buddhism ) and sannou ichijitsu shinto , etc .
the unity of shinto and confucianism line - juka shinto ( teachings on shinto as expounded by japanese confucianists ) and rigaku shinto ( shinto of the fundamental principle ) , etc .
sect shinto
mountain religion line - jikko-kyo ( sect of shinto ) and ontake-kyo ( sect of shinto ) , etc .
reiji line - kurozumikyo sect , konkokyo sect , and tenrikyo sect , etc .
tradition shinto line - izumo oyashiro-kyo ( sect of shinto ) and shinto shusei-ha ( sect of shinto ) , etc .
new thought/idea line : oomoto , seicho-no-ie , byakko shinko kai ( white light association , ) sekai mahikari bunmei kyodan ( world divine light organization , ) sukyo mahikari , suhikari koha sekai shindan , shindo tenkokyo , etc .
** the term ' shinto ' appears in " i ching " ( the book of changes ) and " jin shu " ( history of the jin dynasty ) in china and the term means ' ayashiki michi ' ( 神しき道 . )
this idea is different in character from the conception of shinto in japan .
** the first appearance of ' shinto ' in japan was ' 天皇信佛法尊神道 ' ( emperor believes in buddhism and respects shinto ) in the descriptions of emperor yomei in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan . )
accordingly , shinto represented a japanese peculiar belief which was opposed to buddhism as a foreign religion .
** the lowest phase was ' kido ' and this term appears in gishi wajin den ( the first written record of japan ' s commerce . )
the next phase is ' shinto ' ( ' ayashiki michi ' ( 神しき道 . )
given the above , the term shinto ( ayashiki michi ) in " i ching " and " jin shu " is a derogatory term describing that shinto was more advanced than kido , but was of very low level .
** in 0000 , european and modern religious conceptions were imported in japan , and the religious term ' shinto ' began to be settled .
in 0000 , philosophy of religion was actually introduced and the word ' shinto ' was established in the academic field .
** originally , there was no charismatic founder for shinto like jesus christ or shakyamuni .
therefore , it is believed that shinto had a nature to be easily fused with foreign religions .
however , examples that a native ethnic belief such as shinto and religions of various schools exist together are observed in various areas in the world , and the japanese case is not very rare .
** in fact , after buddhism was first publicly imported to japan , there were conflicts between the mononobe clan in the anti-buddhist faction and the soga clan in the pro-buddhist faction .
in the medieval period , various schools such as ise shinto and yoshida shinto established a complicated framework of theories such as han honji suijaku setsu ( the theory of converse origin and traces . )
** there was another reason that japan had to clearly demonstrate to powerful european countries and the u . s . a . that japan was a modern state .
consequently , after buddhism , confucianism , and christianity were approved , shinto-related aspects continued to exist in the wide scope of people ' s spiritual lives in japan .
when overviewing these , it can be said that embracing aspects has been succeeded by izumo ( shinto ) and social controlling aspects were succeeded by ise ( shinto . )
** while shinto is a polytheistic religion , it has a strong aspect of admiring sorei ( ancestral spirit , collective of ancestral spirits who have lost their individualities , ancestors deified as kami , spirit of a kami ) and respects older things .
** it recognizes that kami exists in everything , including weather , geography , and landscape .
that is , ' yao yorozu no kami ' ( eight million gods . )
this aspect is common for the religion of ainu .
please see kami ( shinto ) for more details .
moreover , there is a custom that a shrine was built , in which a person who performed outstanding accomplishments before the person died was enshrined as kami ( kami of person . )
** on the other hand , it has a nature to take in foreign ' god ' by itself , and many of ' gods ' of primitive religions who were from the eurasian continent are enshrined as ' kami ' in shinto .
among them , some ' gods ' which should have conflicted with one another exist simultaneously .
furthermore , many of saints which were from other countries are regarded as ' god . '
** people in izumo were likely to discuss relations with japanese myths before the heian period , and those characteristics can be clearly identified in izumo " fudoki " ( ancient record of the features of izumo ) , unlike fudoki in other areas .
** in the kamakura period , shinto priests of ise-jingu shrine started academic research , and the shrine gradually made changes and reached the current style of shingi belief ( 神祇信仰 . )
ise school managed to establish the practice of visiting ise-jingu shrine in the late edo period with their earnest efforts and gained support of part of ordinary people with stronger sorei nature , rather than intellectual people .
meanwhile , norinaga motoori succeeded in interpretation of " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , which had been left undecipherable in the edo period , and contributed in forming the origin of the study of japanese classical literature .
shinto and interest in the study of japanese classical literature raised awareness for japan and formed part of the trend of thoughts which led the meiji restoration to success in asia where there were increasing plantations by powerful countries such as america and european countries .
during the process of the establishment of shinto , the ancient times were deeply influenced by buddhism , and in the modern times , the entry of confucianism into japan was significant .
it should be considered that what ise school achieved was efforts of people on the shinto side who were opposing the party .
** shinto of the modern period has been strongly affected by confucianism shinto and fukko shinto in the edo period and state shinto in the meiji period .
** a building where gods belonging to shinto are enshrined is called jinja , and most of the jinja in japan are controlled by jinja-honcho ( 神社本庁 ) ( the association of shinto shrines . )
although the name jinja-honcho ( 神社本庁 ) includes ' cho ( 庁 ) ' , it is not an administrative organ but a religious corporation .
** nowadays , as a result of the separation of government and religion , it will hardly occur that the imperial court and shinto will be apparently connected with each other , but it is a historical fact that the imperial court and shinto were closely related to each other .
while many japanese people practice and have belief in buddhism and shinto at the same time , since the meiji period the imperial court has been more inclined to shinto .
an emperor ( including sosen shin ( ancestral god ) ) is more likely to be a subject of belief in shinto .
** the following briefly describes the common steps and manners with respect to visiting shinto shrines in japan .
however , the steps and manners may differ depending on shrines .
usually , there is a posted sign of how to make a prayer at the shrine .
** it is recommended to visit a shrine on either the 0st or the 00th or both days every month .
before reaching the offering hall , visitors are required to go through a purification ritual to make their bodies and spirits fresh .
that is because the kami ( god ) is believed not to avoid ' impurity ' and therefore it is advisable for visitors to take a bath or shower before visiting a shrine .
before walking through under a torii ( an archway to a shinto shrine ) after arriving at a shrine , visitors are supposed to perform ' isson ' ( deeply bowing at forty-five degrees ) in front of the torii .
before bowing deeply , check your clothing to look nice and neat .
** next , rinse your mouth and hands with fresh water at the purification fountain .
this is intended to purify your mouth and hands ( also spirit ) used for clapping and telling norito and is one of getting rid of impurity .
the steps to use the purifying water are :
** first , take one of the ladles by your right hand , fill it with water , and rinse the left hand by pouring some of the water over the hand three times .
** second , grasp the ladle with your left hand and rinse the right hand three times with some of the remaining water .
** third , grasp the ladle with your right hand again , fill some of the remaining water in the cupped left hand , and rinse the mouth .
finally , rinse the left hand again with the remaining water .
don ' t transfer the water directly to your mouth .
** after rinsing is over , hold the ladle vertically and rinse it by pouring some water over its shaft .
to rinse the shaft is intended to think of the next user , too .
** put the cleaned ladle back to the place upside down and dry your mouth and hands with tissue paper or handkerchief .
** if assisted by a female attendant , behave in manners as advised by her .
after the rinsing steps , head for the main shrine to pray , walking on sando ( an approach to a main shrine ) and when walking on sando , it is advisable to walk on the parts other than the center .
the central of sando is called ' seichu ' , which is a way of the kami .
at the main shrine , first , throw a coin into the offering box for an offering to the kami .
ring a bell near the offering box , which is believed to aim to remove evil and be a sign to call for the kami and begin with a ceremony .
** bow and pray after ringing the bell .
a basic manner of prayer is ' twice bowing , twice clapping and one-time bowing . '
actual movements are :
** bow twice ( bow the straight body from the waist at 00 degrees . )
bow again ( if serving shinto prayers , bow after the prayers are over . )
before and after practicing ' twice bowing , twice clapping and one-time bowing , ' it is much better to perform ichiyu ( a one-time little bow . )
in a prayer , it is common to speak ( loud or at heart ) the address , name , and wishes of the visitor just after clapping twice .
if you want to express thankful feelings in a prayer , follow the same procedure as the above .
although the prayer manner was different in each shrine in the past , unification to the current method , twice bowing , twice clapping and one-time bowing ' was implemented due to the separation of buddhism and shintoism in the meiji period .
however , a few shrines practice different prayer manner ; for example , izumo taisha shrine and usa jingu shrine practice ' four claps . '
** when sacred wine or sake is offered , take it .
drinking sacred wine or sake is thought to get help from the kami .
** if a death occurs in the family , nobody of the family had better visit a shrine for fifty days ( forty nine days based on buddhism ) .
this is because the idea of the impurity of death .
** it is a rule to avoid serving cooked food for the kami .
this is because izanami ( the female who invites ) died of the birth of the kami of fire ( it varies by religious services and area .
grains are excluded in many cases . )
** the kami of mountain does not hate the impurity of blood .

** japanese mythology is a collection of myths that have been passed down in japan .
** introduction
the myths mainly feature the gods of takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) but there are not many original references .
** in general , it is considered that various parts of japan have beliefs and lore of some kind that have been passed down in their respective forms , with izumo as the representative of such lore .
however , among the ainu and the people of ryukyu , who were not under the control of central japanese authority such as the yamato sovereignty until later periods , their own unique myths exist .
** in medieval mythology , some of the gods in kiki ( the kojiki and nihon shoki ) are identified as or treated as equals to the deities in buddhism based on the theory of honjisuijyaku ( gods are a manifestation of buddha ) .
it often contains divinities and items not seen in kiki , and elements from regional myths and folklores and entertainment may be mixed into it .
unlike the myths in kiki , legitimate references never existed , and therefore , rich variations exist .
medieval myths are currently being studied in the field of japanese literature , but rarely are they studied in the research field of mythology .
** furthermore , although small in number , myths unique to japan can be seen in the preachings of christianity as well as in the non-traditional religions of the end of the edo period .
** with the above in mind , this article will include an explanation of japanese mythology with a focus on ' takamanohara mythology ' ( kiki mythology ) mentioned in " the kojiki " and " nihon shoki . "
** the main gods that appear in ' takamanohara mythology ' are described as the ancestors of yamato sovereigns , and consequently , of the present-day imperial family .
for example , it has been pointed out that there is a possibility that the editing of kiki itself was influenced by the court of emperor tenmu and empress jito , and that arbitrary opinions of the imperial court and the fujiwara clan may have been included .
since the tokyo tribunal of war criminals , it is considered that this was used by the government authority as propaganda for advertising the legitimacy of the government to the people in post-meiji and pre-pacific war japan ( kokoku shikan ( emperor-centered historiography based on shintoism ) ) .
** currently , research in mythology focuses mainly on archeological and ethnological approach , such as the environment and customs .
anecdotes that are considered to form the origins of japanese mythology , and myths that share common features with japanese mythology can be found in greek mythology as well as in mythologies of many other countries .
it serves as historical reference material in understanding the political power balance among the provinces between the tumulus period and the nara period in japan .
** with that in mind , ' takamanohara mythology ' will be mentioned here merely as myth , or alternatively , from the view point of archeology and ethnology .
** in this article , only the outline of japanese mythology is presented , and details of each myth should be found elsewhere .
** gods called kotoamatsu kami ( separate heavenly gods ) and kaminoyonanayo ( seven generations of the gods ' world , the primordial seven ) were born in takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) at the beginning of the world .
the last of these gods born were izanagi and izanami .
** izanagi and izanami descended on ashihara no nakatsukuni ( central land of reed plains , which refers to the human world ) , married each other and created one island after another that formed the japanese islands known as oyashima .
izanagi killed kagutsuchi and he set off to the underworld to look for izanami .
however , in the underworld , izanami was already dead and had changed beyond recognition .
izanagi became scared and fled .
izanagi despised the impurity of the underworld and cleansed himself .
various gods were also born on this occasion .
** susanoo wailed because he wanted to go to the underworld where izanami was , and he caused extensive damage to heaven and earth .
then , he went up to takamanohara ruled by amaterasu .
amaterasu thought susanoo came to take over takamanohara , so she greeted susanoo with her bow and arrow ready .
in order to disprove amaterasu ' s suspicion , amaterasu and susanoo created gods with what each other was wearing , and the gender of the gods proved susanoo ' s innocence .
amaterasu forgave susanoo , but because susanoo showed violent behavior in takamanohara , amaterasu hid herself in amano iwado ( cave of heaven ) .
because amaterasu , sun goddess , hid herself the sun did not rise anymore , and this became a problem for the gods .
they came up with a plan and got amaterasu out of amano iwado .
susanoo was expelled to the lower world .
** susanoo descended in izumo province .
he then slew yamatano orochi ( eight-headed and eight-tailed giant snake ) , a monster , and married kushinadahime .
susanoo ' s descendant , okuninushi , married suseribime and began to create ashihara no nakatsukuni with sukunabikona .
** even though these stories are called izumo mythology they are not included in " izumo no kuni fudoki " ( ancient records of culture and the land of izumo province ) .
however , similar names of the gods appear in it .
** gods of takamanohara ( amatsu kami ) , such as amaterasu , asserted that amatsu kami , especially amaterasu ' s descendants , should rule ashihara no nakatsukuni .
therefore , she sent several gods to izumo .
when okuninushi ' s son , kotoshiro nushi takeminakata , descended on amatsu kami , okuninushi also promised to amatsu kami that he would hand over the country in exchange for a palace built for himself .
this palace later became izumo-taisha shrine .
** amaterasu ' s grandson , ninigi , unified ashihara no nakatsukuni , and descended in hyuga province .
ninigi married konohana no sakuyabime .
** ninigi ' s children , hoderi and hoori , had a fight over yamasachihiko losing umisachihiko ' s fishing hook .
yamasachihiko went to the palace of the god of the sea , found the fishing hook and returned it .
yamasachihiko married the daughter of the god of the sea and had a child named ugayafukiaezu .
ugayafukiaezu ' s child was kamuyamato iwarehiko ( or kanyamato iwarehiko . he later became emperor jinmu ) .
** kamuyamato iwarehiko schemed with his older brothers to rule yamato .
the former inhabitants of yamato defied him and kamuyamato iwarehiko struggled in his fight , but they were no match for kamuyamato iwarehiko , who was a descendant of the sun goddess .
kamuyamato iwarehiko was enthroned at the foot of the mountain at unebi no kashihara no miya .
this was the very first emperor , emperor jinmu .
** after emperor jinmu died tagishimimi , a son of emperor jinmu when he lived in hyuga , started an uprising .
emperor suizei defeated him and succeeded to the throne .
** kamununakawamimi became emperor suizei , but there are no records of the 0 emperors after emperor suizei .
** research in mythology
until the edo period , " nihon shoki " was highly valued because it contained the official history edited by the government , but " the kojiki " was not .
** after the meiji period , descriptions in japanese mythology were considered as the divine truth due to kokoku shikan , and the study of mythology regressed even further .
he was oppressed by being charged for defamation against royalty before the second world war , but he drew attention after the war , and tsuda ' s theory became the center of the study of japanese mythology for a while .
nowadays , the fine details of the tsuda theory are not always considered to be correct , but the approach that views japanese mythology as a reflection of historical facts from the yayoi to the tumulus periods without archeological proof , is basically avoided .
** comparative mythology
** among japanese mythology , there exist many myths that are noted for being similar to other mythologies .
** there is a theory that states that there is a similarity between the legend of alexander the great and emperor jinmu ' s expedition .
** izanami and izanagi were siblings , but myths that have the first man and the first woman , who are the ancestors of human beings , as siblings can be found widely from south asia to polynesia .
** there is a story of a white rabbit of inaba , who tricked sharks and used them in order to get across the sea , and there are folktales in southern islands whose contents are similar but with different animals .
** shintoshu ( collection of shrine legends )
** composition
** shintoshu is a collection of anecdotes and shinto books in medieval japan .
** it is thought that the book was written by the agui shodo school in the mid period of the northern and southern courts ( japan . )
shintoshu consists of ten volumes and contains fifty anecdotes .
** it contains anecdotes about shinto and buddhist deities which are based on honji-suijaku setsu ( theory of original reality and manifested traces ) , centering on engi ( writing about history ) about shrines in togoku ( the eastern part of japan ) including the kanto region .
suwa engi no koto ' ( story of the origin of the suwa deity ) is known to tell the tradition of saburo koga .

** sanshu no jingi or mikusa no kamudakara ( the three sacred treasures of the imperial family )
** summary
** the legend behind each of the jingi ( the three sacred treasures )
** yata no kagami ( mirror )
** yasakani no magatama ( jewel )
** ama no murakumo no tsurugi ( sword )
** history
** these three treasures have been handed down by the emperors of japan .
** the term jingi ( sacred treasures ) means " yorishiro of the gods " ( objects representative of a divine spirit ) .
** possession of the mirror , the sword replica and the jewel is a recognized symbol , demonstrating authentic succession to the imperial throne by the emperor .
however , a number of emperors , such as emperor gotoba ascended the throne without the three sacred treasures .
thus , they are not necessarily essential for enthronement .
** it is said that the term ' jingi ' became common around the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) .
** in the main text of " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , there is no article describing this grant of the three sacred treasures .
** a combination of the three items--a mirror , a sword , and a jewel--was not unique only to the imperial family but regarded as symbols common to all rulers .
princess kamunatsuso of the suo province ' s saba ( land under direct control of the emperor ) that showed allegiance to emperor keiko , also offered a yatsuka no tsurugi ( yatsuka sword ) , yata no kagami ( mirror ) and yasakani ( jewel ) .
in the harunotsuji ruins in iki city , a combination of the oldest mirror , sword and jewel were excavated .
** the yasakani no magatama ( jewel ) is stored in the residence of the imperial palace .
** in addition , it is believed that replicas of the yata no kagami ( mirror ) and the ama no murakumo no tsurugi ( sword ) are in the imperial palace .
** after the introduction of confucianism to japan , some have interpreted the three sacred treasures as representations of santoku ( the three primary virtues ) : the mirror representing " wisdom , " the jewel representing " benevolence , " and the sword representing " valor . "
** the way of referring to these three items as " sanshu no jingi " ( three sacred treasures of the imperial family ) is found in books such as " the tale of the heike " and " jinno shotoki " ( a chronicle of gods and sovereigns ) .
the " jinno shotoki " also names these items " sanshuno shinbo " and " mikusa no kamudakara . "
** refer to the section on yata no kagami for details .
** when amaterasu made a small opening in the rock , the mirror reflected her face , drawing her attention and successfully making her come out of the cave , thus bringing light back to the world .
it is said that amaterasu omikami later granted the mirror to her grandson ninigi-no-mikoto .
currently the mirror is an offering at the kotai jingu shrine of ise jingu shrine .
** refer to the section on yasakani no magatama for details .
** yasakani no magatama ' 八尺瓊勾玉 ' is also sometimes written as ' 八坂瓊曲玉 . '
the magatama was made in the shape of a large bead .
it has been suggested that the magatama is connected to a strap with a length of eight saka ( ' saka ' is a unit of measurement that was used in ancient times ; eight aka is about 0 . 0 meters long ) .
the jewel was created by the god tama-no-oya-no-mikoto and hung on a sakaki tree ( a species of evergreen sacred to shinto ) along with the yata no kagami ( mirror ) when amaterasu hid in the ama no iwato ( cave of the sun god ) .
** refer to the section on ama no murakumo no tsurugi sword for details .
** the sword is also called kusanagi no tsurugi .
according to the izumo no kuni fudoki ( topography of izumo province ) , orochi ( the eight forked great serpent ) was vanquished in mori-go , ou-gun , izumo province ( now yasugi city , shimane prefecture ) .
there are some who suggest that the blacksmith god ame-no-mahitotsu no mikoto made the sword .
** it took a total of sixty years before it was handed down to yamatohime no mikoto , a princess of emperor suinin ( reported 00b . c . to 00b . c . ) and finally enshrined in the current kotai-jingu shrine ( naiku ) of ise jingu shrine .
princess yamatohime no mikoto later handed it to yamato takeru no mikoto , who set off for the east to suppress barbarian tribes .
it has been suggested that because yamato takeru used the sword at that time to cut down grass in order to escape from an attack of burning fields , the sword was given the name kusanagi no tsurugi ( literally " grass-mowing sword " ) .
a more convincing theory , however , is that " kusa " stands for " smell " ( or " having the aura of " ) , and " nagi " stands for " snake , " therefore the original meaning is " the sword of a snake . "
after yamato takeru no mikoto died of illness , the sword was dedicated to atsuta-jingu shrine .
** at what point did they start having the ritual of presenting the three sacred treasures ( jingi ) to the emperor during the enthronement ceremony ?
no description is found in " kojiki " regarding sacred treasures ( jingi ) or the equivalent hoken ( treasured sword ) for enthronement .
the following can be see in the " nihon shoki " ( " chronicles of japan " ) .
** an article from december of the first year of emperor ingyo states , ' at this moment , the crowd of retainers felt great happiness , immediately presenting the emperor ' s treasures and admiring them . '
** an article from december of emperor kenzo states , ' the vassals met with the emperor . '
imperial prince oke took the sacred treasures and placed them on the emperor ' s throne . '
** an article from february of the first year of emperor keitai states , " the omuraji otomo no kanamura knelt down and presented the sacred treasures of the mirror and the sword . '
** an article from december of emperor senka states , ' the vassals presented the sword and the mirror to takeohirokuni oshitate no mikoto which immediately made him an emperor . '
** an article from november of emperor suiko states , ' many vassals went out to ask for donations for a temple . 三に至りて乃ち従ひたまふ . '
as such , they are presented the sacred treasures of the emperor . '
** an article from january of the first year of emperor jomei states , ' ministers and vassals presented the sacred treasures to imperial prince tamura . '
** the following are descriptions that are not on the enthronement ceremony but are related articles .
** an article from june of emperor kotoku states , ' princess ametoyotakaraikashihitarashihime was presented with the sacred treasures and conferred an empress . '
** the keitai section and the senka section are the only two sections that specifically define the items as a mirror and a sword .
this raises the question about whether or not the treasures might be of different origins .
** in 000 when empress jito ascended the throne , the inbe clan as retainers presented two forms of treasure : a sword and a mirror .
the magatama was added to the treasures when the nakatomi clan claimed there were three kinds .
** the following is based on the theory that the jingi were in the imperial court .
there is no record of any of the jingi being carried away from ise jingu shrine .
** in the naval battle of dan-no-ura in 0000 between the taira clan and the minamoto clan , it is said that the kusanagi no tsurugi ( sword ) sank into the sea with emperor antoku in akamagaseki ( kanmon-kaikyo strait ) .
also during this time , despite the absence of the three sacred treasures , emperor gotoba ascended the throne based on the inzen ( imperial decree ) of the cloistered emperor goshirakawa .
** in 0000 , takauji ashikaga defected from the kenmu restoration of emperor godaigo and established the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) in kyoto by putting emperor komyo on the throne of the northern court ( japan ) .
however , emperor godaigo claimed that the jingi he had given to the northern court was a fake , that he had the legitimate right to succeed the imperial throne and established the sourthern court ( japan ) in yoshino ( yoshino-cho , yoshino-gun , nara prefecture ) .
these events led to the beginning of the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) .
after the shohei itto ( temporary unification of the northern and southern courts ) , when the southern court temporarily recaptured kyoto and kidnapped three retired emperors of the northern court , they also confiscated the jingi .
as a result , emperors of the northern court , including emperor kogen , ascended the throne without the jingi following a precedent of emperor gotoba .
in " kitabatake chikafusa no jinno shotoki " ( chikafusa kitabakake ' s chronicle of gods and sovereigns ) , chikafusa kitabake of the southern court emphasized the importance of the blood line , virtue and the jingi as conditions for a monarch .
the jingi are not necessarily essential for enthronement , however , as there was the precedent of emperor gotoba ascending to the throne under the inzen ( decree from the retired emperor ) of the cloistered emperor goshirakawa .
** in 0000 , the jingi retained by the southern court were handed from emperor gokameyama of the southern court to the emperor gokomatsu of the northern court when the northern and southern courts joined through the mediation of yoshimitsu ashikaga .
** in 0000 , the " conspiracy of kinketsu " occurred in which surviving retainers of the southern court forced their way into the gosho ( imperial palace ) to steal the jingi .
the magatama was kept under the control of gonancho ( second southern court ) but reportedly recovered before 0000 .
** in the meiji period , a dispute called ' nanbokucho-seijunron ' occurred where both the northern and southern dynasties argued over the legitimacy of the imperial line .
in the end , emperor meiji determined that the southern court held legitimacy on the grounds that they owned the three sacred imperial treasures .
** on january 0 , 0000 , emperor akihito inherited the jingi in the " inheritance ceremony of kenji and others " that was held in the matsu no ma ( state room ) of the imperial palace .
** controversy over the existence or disappearance of the treasures
there are various opinions over the existence or disappearance of the jingi .
whatever happened , the importance of the three sacred imperial treasures may lie in " the belief that the imperial family own them . "
in other words , what is important is not whether " the imperial family owns the three sacred imperial treasures , " but that the three sacred imperial treasures are " what the imperial family owns . "
** in the first place , what are actually used in the ceremony are ' katashiro ' ( incarnations or replicas ) .
it is said that even the emperor , the head priest of the ise shrine , is not allowed to see the real objects .
this means that there is no way of determining whether the real objects are present or not .
** it is said that the yata no kagami ( mirror ) dedicated to ise jingu shine as a shintai ( object of worship housed in a shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) is the mirror that has existed since ancient times .
the mirror is enshrined in a container called a mihishiro .
( one theory suggests that the yata no kagami in ise is destroyed during every shikinen sengu and replaced by a new one , but it is not known where this theory comes from . )
** the mirror shintai is enshrined in kashikodokoro in the imperial palace as a katashiro ( replica ) of the yata no kagami , but there is a record that it was once burnt in a fire .
in the kashikodokoro in the imperial palace , there are mihishiro ( containers ) for two pieces of shintai , one of which is a newly made mihishiro that contains the remains of an item burnt in a fire .
the other contains a substitute mirror that was prepared after the fire .
these were collected after the battle of dan-no-ura between the minamoto and taira clans .
** the ama no murakumo no tsurugi ( sword ) enshrined in the atsuta-jingu shrine is believed to be the sword that has existed since ancient times .
however , one theory suggests that among the three sacred treasures , the sword does not exist because it had sunk into the sea with the fall of the heike family ( the taira clan ) .
** during the battle of dan-no-ura , the divine sword sunk in the sea along with nii no ama when he committed suicide by drowning while holding emperor antoku and wearing the sword on his side .
however , this was not the real sword , but a katashiro ( replica ) .
later on another sword as a katashiro was selected among swords stored in the sacred warehouse of the ise jingu shrine and has existed since ancient times .
** in the battle of dan-no-ura between the minamoto clan and taira clan , the magatama ( jewel ) sunk in the sea with emperor antoku when nii no ama , who held the emperor and the box containing the magatama , committed suicide by drowning .
the magatama rose to the surface in its box and was collected by soldiers of the minamoto clan who hastily rowed to the spot after watching them sink in the sea .
it is believed that this magatama exists and has been stored in the imperial palace since ancient times .
** kiki
** kiki is a collective designation of the " kojiki " and " nihonshoki . "
記紀 ' was made using both ' 記 ' of " 古事記 " and ' 紀 ' of " 日本書紀 . "
** both books are important history books telling and describing japanese myths compiled in the nara period and ancient history .
they each contain only myths in the beginning part of the book and take on more characteristics of a history book as the writing approaches the era when these books were written .
careful assessment is required , but since the historical materials in that era are very few , they are still important as historical materials .
** rikkokushi ( the six national histories )
** " rikkokushi " represents six national historical books which were compiled by the japanese nation under the ritsuryo codes in ancient times .
they were mostly written in chronological order , partially taking on the factors of biographical historiography .
** summary
the compilation of history books was continued for a national project of japan over the period ranging from the asuka period to the early heian period ; six history books were produced , which are called rikkokushi .
therefore , if people simply say kokushi in japan , they could mean rikkokushi .
** there is a record that " tennoki " ( a record of the emperors ) and " national record " were compiled before nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) , but these books don ' t exist .
it is believed that although there was a plan to compile a national history book called ' shinkokushi ' ( the new national history ) after the rikkokushi , it was not completed .
after the meiji restoration , it was also planned to compile a history book covering the period after rikkokushi , but it was not realized due to various reasons , and instead , dai nihon shiryo ( the historical materials of japan ) was produced .

** fudoki ( description of regional climate , culture , etc . )
** " fudoki " is a title of chinese books .
these books are thought to carry the summary of what was observed and heard about people ' s lives in remote regions , but the details are uncertain .
** it is an item in which the information of the culture , climate , topography , etc of each province was recorded and compiled in the nara period in japan .
it is also called ' kofudoki ' ( ancient fudoki compiled by imperial order in 000 ce ) to differentiate it from other fudoki , although it is not an official name .
fudoki is thought to have been prepared for each province under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) and some fudoki ' s manuscripts have been restored .

** the theory that the sword is kept in the imperial court
** other theories
** the sword is also called ' kusanagi no tsurugi , ' ' kusanagi no ken , ' ' tsumugari no tachi ' and ' yaegaki no tsurugi . '
among the ' sanshu no jingi ' ( the three imperial regalia ) , it is considered to be the symbol of the emperor ' s military power
** it was given the name ' ama no murakumo no tsurugi ' due to the fact that clouds were always gathering over the head of the eight-forked serpent .
susanoo presented the sword to amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) who then handed it to her grandson ninigi when he descended from heaven to rule over the country .
** it took nearly sixty years before the sword was handed down to princess yamatohime no mikoto , a daughter of emperor suinin ( reportedly between 00 to 00 b . c . ) , and was finally enshrined in the current kotai-jingu shrine of ise jingu shrine .
this description is from the " kogo shui " ( a historical record of the inbe clan ) .
( detailed story : former ise )
** later on , princess yamatohime gave the sword to yamato takeru , who set off for ' togoku ' ( eastern japan ) to suppress barbarian tribes .
after the expedition to ' togoku , ' takeru left the sword with his wife miyazu hime , whom he married in owari province , and went to defeat the evil god of ibuki-yama mountain .
however , takeru became sick from a trap set by the mountain god and died on the way to the mountain .
in order to enshrine the sword , miyazu hime built atsuta-jingu shrine .
** although there are various stories regarding the origin of the sword , the real story remains unknown .
** furthermore , the name ' ame no murakumo no mikoto ' is also seen in the ancestry of the watarai clan , which was a family of shinto priests recorded in " toyouke-daijingu negi honin shidai " ( an old historical japanese record ) .
** the following story is from a section in the " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
the sword was named ' ama no murakumo no tsurugi ' due to the fact that there were always clouds above the head of yamata no orochi ( the eight-forked serpent ) .
in reality , there are many cloudy days in the san-in region ( an area in the southwest of honshu , the main island of japan ) .
even today , people visiting the izumo aki region are often told , " even if you forget to bring a lunch , do not forget to bring an umbrella . "
deep in the mountains of the aki region , at the top of sentsu-zan ( torikami ) mountain in the town of okuizimo , there is a stone monument bearing the inscription : " this is the location where the ama no murakumo no tsurugi was discovered . "
every year on july 00th , the ' commemoration of the sentsu-zan mountain monument - senyo-sai festival ' is held at this location .
however , a number of questions have been raised .
included in these questions is the point about the sacred sword being carelessly handed to yamato takeru and how likely it is that he used the sword to cut grass .
in response to this question , there have been debates over whether the two swords , the ' ama no murakumo no tsurugi ' and the ' kusanagi no tsurugi , ' might have historically been two different swords .
however , in taking records such as the ' kojiki ' ( records of ancient matters ) into account , this is the most widely accepted theory .
** the names of ' ama no murakumo no tsurugi ' and ' murakumo ' were written only as annotations in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
these names were not written at all in the " kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) .
the original name of the sword is therefore considered to be ' kusanagi no tsurugi . '
therefore , it is often argued that the sword is related to ' zanda no tsurugi ' ( the sword used for killing snakes ) that was possessed by emperor gaozu of the han .
** yamato takeru received the sacred sword at the ise jingu shrine and used it to fight off a grass fire , warding off a calamity and gave it the name ' kusanagi no tsurugi . '
this is a widely known theory behind the sword .
** according to japanese mythology as well , the sword came from the tail of yamata no orochi , a monstrous serpent .
likewise , this means that within the oral tradition as well , the sword can be considered a " hebi no tsurugi . '
in other words , the original meaning of ' kusanagi no tsurugi ' bears a sinister connotation of ' jada no tsurugi ' ( the sword of an evil serpent ) , coming from the tail of a monstrous serpent .
** he concludes that the name of the sword refers to the sword of a serpent with holy power .
the name also relates to ' kushinada hime ' who was nearly sacrificed to yamata no orochi .
while kushinada hime was originally the person who enshrined ' yamata no orochi ' , she was considered to be a female who ruled over the izumo province .
** due to the fact that the sword is so extremely valuable to japanese mythology , its various journeys of being imitated , copied , stolen , lost and sunk in water have all been traced .
consequently , there are various views on where the sword is now kept .
** this theory suggests that the sword has been kept in the most secluded room of atsuta-jingu shrine as a ' shintai ' ( object of worship housed in a shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) .
the following description is given in japanese mythology .
** in 000 , a monk named dogyo from silla ( one of the three kingdoms of korea ) attempted to steal the sacred sword kept in atsuta-jingu shrine and bring it back to silla .
he failed in the attempt , however , due to a shipwreck , after which the sword was kept in the imperial court ( see the case on the theft of the ' kusanagi no tsurugi ' ) .
when emperor tenmu fell sick in 000 , a rumor was circulated that it was due the curse of the sword .
the sword was therefore placed back in the atsuta-jingu shrine .
** there is a record that a shinto priest of the edo period stole a glance at the sword .
according to the record , the sword was about eighty-five centimeters in length , similar to the leaf of an iris , white in color and gathered no rust .
there is also an anecdote which tells how the priest who stole the glance died due to the curse of the sword .
the present-day japan broadcasting corporation attempted to collect information about the controversial sword in atsuta-jingu shrine but were not allowed to see it .
( this description came from the program called " kodai-shi no nazo ni idomu " ( unveiling mysteries of ancient history ) )
** there is a theory that suggests that although the sacred sword enshrined in atsuta-jingu shrine and the imperial household ( the yamato dynasty ) were originally unrelated , a mythical description was created in order to tie them together .
on the contrary , there are other theories , such as one describing how the yamato dynasty gave the sword to the owari clan in order to win them over and that was how it became the sacred sword .
** this theory states that tira no tokiko drowned herself in the sea while wearing the sacred sword at her side during the battle of dan-no-ura and it was never found again .
** this is one theory that has been passed on through the ages .
** there is a theory that the sword held by taira no tokiko at the time she drowned was a replica that was originally used in the imperial court .
this theory was also adopted in ' heike monogatari - tsurugi no maki ' ( tales of the heike family - volume on the sword ) .
** this theory argues that the sword used in the ceremony of the imperial court is the actual sword .
** another theory is that the name of the sword came from the name of present-day ' murakumo town ' in showa ward , nagoya city , aichi prefecture .
** nagasunehiko
** nagasunehiko is a character that appears in japanese mythology .
in " the kojiki " ( records of ancient matters ) he is written as nagasunehiko , but he is also called tominonagasunehiko as well as tomibiko .
he is portrayed in the scene of jinmu tosei ( emperor jinmu ' s expedition to the east ) as the head of a local ruling family in the yamato province area who opposed jinmu ' s expedition to the east .
** he later fought again , against the imperial army who killed yasotakeru and eshiki .
at this time , a golden kite flew by and perched itself on the nock of emperor jinmu ' s bow , and nagasunehiko ' s army was blinded and could not fight .
the emperor showed ame no haha ya ( the heavenly feathered arrows ) and kachiyuki ( japanese quiver ) as his proof of being amatsu kami ' s son , and even though nagasunehiko was awed , he did not change his views .
therefore , he was killed by nigihayahi no mikoto , who realized that it was impossible to mediate between the emperor and nagasunehiko .
** in kiki ( the kojiki and nihonshoki ) , nagasune is said to be the name of a large village .
** it is said that his descendant was tominoichii who defeated mononobe no moriya with prince shotoku .
** saishu ( chief priest )
** summary
** modern times
** saishu was a post within shinto priesthood that was set up exclusively in the ise-jingu shrine .
** in ancient times , the post was classified as a ryoge no kan ( a class outside of the ritsuryo system [a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code] ) .
** the role of the post was to visit shrines in ise and recite prayers conveying the wishes of the emperor to the enshrined deity during the kinensai ( prayer service for a good crop ) , tsukinami-sai festival and kannamesai festival .
** when the shrine was an organization of the state , the saishu was in charge of general affairs and the transfer of a deity in the ise shrine during jingu shikinen sengu .
** posts using the name of saishu were established in shrines other than ise-jingu shrine , but these posts were clearly different .
** atsuko ikeda , for example , now serves as a saishu which is a post assumed by women born from the imperial family after the second world war .
** in modern times , the inheritance of the post by the fujinami family was abolished as the hereditary system of shake ( a family of shinto priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis ) was repealed and the peerage was appointed to jingu saishu .
** later on , saishu became an official post appointed by the emperor to an imperial family member or duke and was legally established by imperial edict to regulate the ise-jingu shrine .
** after the war , the ise-jingu shrine was no longer affiliated with the state and became a religious corporation under the shinto directive and the constitution of japan .
currently the ' regulation ' for the shrine as a religious corporation provides that ' saishu are to be appointed in obedience to imperial order . '
a woman originally from the imperial family assumes the post .
** due to the fact that imperial princess kuninomiya asahiko was the first saishu of imperial blood , her descendants often assume the post .
although atsuta-jingu shrine had planned to set up a saishu post , the plan was not implemented .
** guji
** explanation
** guji ( or miyazukasa ) is a job grade for chief shinto priests , who manage all other shinto priests and miko ( shrine maidens ) .
** at izumo taisha shrine , there is also a position called the kyoto between the guji and gonguji .
at ise jingu shrine , the position immediately below the saishu , the head priest , is the guji , and the guji position is divided into daiguji ( high priest of a great shrine ) and shoguji ( assistant to the high priest of a great shrine ) .
** in the olden days , miya , gu or shrine signified a residence for the imperial family , and the guji used to be a court official serving the court for the crown prince , empress and other imperial family members .
later , the job of the guji was changed to a position engaging in the construction of shrines and tax collection , which was further changed to a position for those who served the gods and were in charge of court rituals .
** under the shrine system after the meiji period , guji became a title for the chief of the kanpeisha ( shrines designated as official by the jingikan , the department of religious affairs ) or the kokuheisha ( shrines under the control of the provincial governors ) .
after wwii , when shrine ranking became a thing of the past , guji became the title for chiefs of all shrines .
** guji after the war
the guji is a person responsible for the shrine rituals , and the manager of shrine administration and all staff working within the shrine .
according to the regulations of the association of shinto shrines , the guji is the executive representative of the shrine as a religious corporation ; and as a rule , only the guji can become the executive representative . .
therefore , there must always be a person in the post of guji at every shrine .
** guji for the shrines under the association of shinto shrines are appointed by the tori of the association of shinto shrines ( excluding the daiguji of ise jingu shrine , who are appointed by imperial decision ) .
some smaller shrines only have one staff , the guji , and it is not rare to find one guji concurrently serving several shrines .
** therefore , there are more guji than gonnegi , even though the guji is a higher ranking priest than the gonnegi .
** guji for beppyo jinja must be ranked as meikai ( the second highest rank of shinto priest ) or higher , and guji for other shrines must be ranked as gonseikai ( the fourth rank of shinto priest ) in order to be appointed to the position .
** in the event that a guji is not appointed due to circumstances beyond control ( such as the death of a guji with no successor ) , a temporary guji will be appointed until the official appointment of the next guji .
in most cases , executives or counselors of the shrine agency with jurisdiction over the shrine are appointed to the position .
** in the event that the guji , who had previously served for extended period and showed an outstanding achievement in shinto , retires , he will be given a title as an honorary chief priest based on the recommendation of the next guji .
** shinkan
** " shinkan " is a person serving a certain god or working as a government official at a facility where god is worshipped .
there are no shinkan in japan at present .
** after the greater east asian war ( world war ii ) was lost , the jinkan related system was discontinued based on the shinto directive issued by the general headquarters of the allied powers .
** in ancient egypt , greece , and rome , people ( mainly men ) who served at shrines were called jinkan .
** subculture and explanation of shinkan
shinkan appearing in fantasies and roleplaying games means a clergyman who is not related to a particular religion , or a clergyman in christianity ( a priest or pastor ) can be called shinkan .
** yata no kagami
** summary
** yata no kagami is a mirror and one of the sanshu no jingi ( three imperial regalia ) .
in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , there is a description stating that ' the mirror was also referred to as mafutsu no kagami mirror . '
** according to japanese mythology , the mirror was made by the goddess ishikoridome no mikoto when amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) was hiding behind the ama no iwato , the gate of the celestial rock cave .
when amaterasu omikami made a narrow opening in the rock gate , she saw a reflection of herself in the mirror .
attracting her interest , the reflection made her come out of the cave and the world became bright once more .
during tensonkorin ( the descent to earth by the grandson of the sun goddess ) , amaterasu omikami gave the mirror to her grandson ninigi .
she issued a shinchoku , a divine decree ( hokyo hosai no shinchoku , literally meaning " a decree to enshrine the treasure mirror " ) to have the mirror enshrined with her own reflection .
** an ' ata ' ( the ' ata ' coming after the ' y ' of ' yata ' ) was a unit for measuring circumference , with one ata being equivalent to approximately twenty-four centimeters .
having a diameter of twenty-four centimeters was regarded as a circumference of four ' ata . '
this means that the yata no kagami was a round mirror forty-six centimeters in diameter .
yata no kagami is thought to have originally been a common noun signifying a mirror used in shinto rituals , then later becoming a proper noun to specify the mirror of the three imperial regalia .
** there are several theories about the location of the yata no kagami .
** according to documents such as the " shito gobusho " ( a five-volume apologia of shinto ) , the word ' hachiyo ' is written on the mirror that was enshrined in the inner shrine of ise .
dairoku harada estimates that the mirror had the same shape of the naiko kamonkyo mirror , which was excavated from the hirabaru ruins in maebara city , fukuoka prefecture .
the mirror in the inner shrine of ise is said to have been sealed after being viewed by the meiji emperor .
** amaterasu omikami is also referred to as ' naishidokoro ' since the mirror was placed in the naishidokoro in the imperial palace .
** sendai kujihongi
** sendai kujihongi is a book on ancient japanese history .
scholastically speaking , it is considered a forged document .
some view that the document has partial documentary value ( to be explained later ) .
the document is also called " kujiki " or " kujihongi . "
it consists of 00 volumes with historical documentation from the birth of the world ( japanese myth ) to the time of emperor suiko .
sendai kujihongi taiseikyo ' ( enpo edition ) and two others , are forged documents ( koshi koden ( ancient history and legends ) ) written during the edo period , based on the sendai kujihongi .
** establishment/author
during the edo period , the document was questioned as being forged , and the study conducted by mitsukuni tokugawa and sadatake ise revealed that the document was in fact a forgery .
the document was assumed to be written after the daido period ( 000-000 ) and before the engi shoki koen ( lecture on the " chronicles of japan " in the engi era ) ( 000-000 ) .
** most parts of the document are patchworks of texts from the " kojiki , " " nihonshoki " and " kogo-shui " ( history of the inbe clan ) ; however , there are some areas describing traditions and deities that are unique to the document .
a japanese classical literature scholar , kiyonao mikannagi ( 0000-0000 ) named okihara no miniku , a teacher of law in the ritsuryo system , as the possible compiler of the document .
okihara no miniku belonged to the mononobe clan ( his original name was mononobe no okihisa ) , and he was most active during the period when the " sendai kujihongi " was written .
there are other theories as to who the compiler was other than okihara no minoku , and some of the candidates that came up were shinto priests of the isonokami-jingu shrine , yakatsugu isonokami and yatabe no kinmochi .
** public estimation
in the prologue of the document , it states that it was written by prince shotoku and soga no umako , and was respected by shintoists during the middle ages .

** kenji ( divine sword and jewel )
** kenji-doza ( the transport of the kenji )
** kenji togyo no gi ( the succession ceremony of the kenji )
** kenji is the term used when combining the ame no murakumo no tsurugi ( literally " heavenly sword of assembled clouds " ) and the yasakani no magatama ( comma-shaped jewel ) , two of the sanshu no jingi ( three sacred treasures of the imperial family ) .
the jewel of the imperial treasures is referred to as the ' ji ' of ' kenji ' ( or ' shinji ' meaning ' divine jewel ' ) .
** the divine mirror ( a replica of the yata no kagami ) is enshrined as a shintai ( an object of worship housed in a shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) of the three shrines in the imperial court .
** before world war ii , a chamberlain accompanying the emperor would carry the divine sword and jewel when the emperor left the imperial palace to travel for two or more days .
this is referred to as kenji-doza .
although kenji-doza has been performed a number of times since the end of world war ii as well , it occurs infrequently .
the emperor visited ise-jingu shrine with the divine sword and jewel after his enthronement .
** kenji togyo no gi is performed when the emperor abdicates the throne or passes away and the imperial heir accedes the throne .
it is a succession ceremony to transfer the divine sword and jewel to the new emperor as symbol of the imperial throne .
since the sword and the jewel are considered sacred objects , they are considered to move to the new emperor on their own , so the expression used is ' togyo ' ( an honorific term for ' transfer ' of gods or emperors ) .
** in this ceremony , however , the divine mirror is not transferred since it is a sacred object of the kashikodokoro ( the sanctuary ) of the three shrines in the imperial court .
at the kashikodokoro , ' kashikodokoro no gi ' ( ceremony in the sanctuary in the imperial palace ) is performed at the same time as ' kenji togyo no gi ' to inform the gods of the completed enthronement .
** on january 0 , 0000 , when akihito succeeded the throne , the ceremony was referred to as ' the ceremony of the kenji and others ' in accordance with the principle of separation of religion and state .
this ceremony was broadcasted on television .
** kyuji ( a record of stories current at court )
** there is a theory that " teiki " and " kyuji " were not separate books but a unified book .
** sokichi tsuda regarded that ' kyuji ' had become the original of the narrative and mythological part in the description of the kiki .

** " omoto shinyu " is a collection of literary work in which ofudesaki ( the holy scriptures of omoto ) was edited .
** it was allegedly in huge volumes , over fifty thousand pieces of hanshi ( standard-size japanese writing paper ) .
** later , kisaburo ueda ( later onizaburo deguchi ) started to assist the activities , which came to develop organizationally .
** the religious corporation oomoto ( hereafter " oomoto " ) called what was written then ofudesaki , which has been left as the holiest scripture of oomoto .
** ( oomoto traditionally treats manyoshu and kojiki as holy scriptures . )
** it is said that both of them then gradually realized mutually that they were run by the will of one powerful god , and they came to walk one path .
** this scripture is written only in hiragana letters , and the scripture defines that it is described in this way by god ' s will .
however , since it had neither punctuation marks nor kanji ( chinese characters ) , it could be understood in various meanings when reading it through , so it was considered to be difficult to make it out correctly before the emergence of onizaburo deguchi .
** one who has the ability to examine if the possessing status is done by a high-ranking spirit and a good deity is called " saniwa . "
amidst that backdrop , the power of a saniwa expert , onizaburo deguchi , was needed at that time .
** some people might have doubts about omoto shinyu .
** those who doubt generally say as below .
** in the same way , they demonstrated and criticized as below .
** although it is said that onizaburo deguchi edited the shinyu from the scripture , onizaburo deguchi himself stated something doubtful .
** on the other hand , religious corporation oomoto doesn ' t acknowledge that there are parts that wasaburo asano edited in omoto shinyu .
** it has been announced that omoto shinyu is a document based on ofudesaki .

** shugo
** summary
** example of syncretism
** shugo is a mixture of buddha , bodhisattvas and deities worshipped by various religions , or a category that considers them as one religion .
syncretism
** syncretism occurs mainly when a religious belief that has established itself in a specific region and a new religion come into contact and similarities are found within their beliefs .
syncretism takes place in two styles : one completely absorbing the other or the two religious beliefs combined , giving itself a joint name .
there are cases where a sect goes through changes after being introduced to a new place and then considered being heretical or the opposite case as in india , the origin of buddhism , where it dies down .
whether the sect is considered legitimate or heretic is relative , while both parties asserting its legitimacy and ' heretics ' is a label for the opposition .
normally , the sect with stronger constituents and a larger number of followers is more apt to be considered legitimate .
** when the divinities of shinto and the deities of buddhism are combined , it is called a syncretism of shinto and buddhism .
** christmas on december 00 is traditionally known as a christian event for being jesus christ ' s birthday , however , there is no mention of this written in the bible .
it seems that christmas originated when christianity spread into europe and the celebration was combined with the festival of the winter solstice that took place in various locations within europe .
** in egyptian myths , there is the case of throth and hedj-wer , both the god of wisdom , where one god absorbed the other .
throth , which was originally in the form of an african threskiornis , and hedj-wer , in the form of a baboon , were both gods of wisdom and ended up in the form of throth with an addition of the shape of a baboon . .
ra-atum is an example of the composite names of ra and atum , both of which were the gods of creation .
** in east asia , taoism , confucianism and buddhism from india mixed with each other and are called the ' three great religions of china ' .
** shaku nihongi ( annotated text of the nihon shoki )
** " shaku nihongi " is an annoted text of " nihon shoki " ( chronicles of japan ) which is assumed to have been compiled at the end of kamakura period , probably between 0000 and 0000 .
its editorial supervisor was kanekata urabe .
00 volumes in total .
** besides providing strict interpretations of the original text of nihon shoki , it also includes many citations from other historical documents which have been lost .
because of this , shaku nihongi has been considered a highly valuable historical document which supplements the parts lacking in " kojiki " and " nihon shoki . "
** kokuiko ( thoughts on the meaning of the nation )
** history
** content
** impact
** " kokuiko " is a literary work by kamo no mabuchi , a scholar of japanese classical literature in the edo period .
kokui ' means japanese spirit .
** " kokuiko " represents a part of the sense of ancient shinto as understood by kamo no mabuchi .
** mabuchi advocated that shinto , or kannagara no michi ( shinto , way of gods ) , was the main way of heaven , earth , and nature , as descended since ancient times , but it had become turbid due to buddhism and confucianism which were introduced later .
the duty of a scholar of japanese classical literature is to recapture the original purity of shinto through research of japanese classics .
on that premise , " kokuiko " is focused on the affirmation that teachings such as shushigaku ( neo-confucianism ) should be eliminated and one must return to the original life and spirit of the japanese .
kokui ' refers to this japanese spirit , and it is preached as being a circle consisting of a smooth arch instead of a multilateral rectangular like shushigaku .
put simply , mabuchi advocated that intrinsically , the minds of the japanese people outweighed mitigation over incommodity , and tenderness over severity .
** kokuiko was also used in japan during the pacific war for its idea of protecting the ' unbroken line of sovereignty in the hands of emperors ' as well as by being understood as the source of the ' reverence for the emperor . '

** structure
** sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki ( records of the age of the gods from the sumiyoshi-taisha shrine ) was an ancient book introducing the origin of the sumiyoshi-taisha shrine that resided there from ancient times .
it consists of one volume , containing 000 lines .
it is one of the important books for the study of ancient history .
it has been designated as an important cultural property .
** " sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki " was a letter to jingikan ( department of worship ) in which a shinto priest of sumiyoshi-taisha shrine described the origin of the shrine .
among historical materials , the name of " jindaiki " first appeared in fujiwara no teika ' s " meigetsuki . "
according to fujiwara no teika , when there was a territorial issue between sumiyoshi-taisha shrine and shitenno-ji temple , the shrine submitted " jindaiki " as evidence .
although " jindaiki " was quite often referred to in historical materials , it was a document designed to be kept secret , and therefore not even family of the priests were allowed to view it .
the original document " jindaiki " ( in the book collection of sumiyoshi-taisha shrine ) became widely known after the showa era started , and in 0000 , a real size photocopy of it was published by naokazu miyaji .
the book was properly studied by takashi tanaka , and in 0000 , he published a research book " sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki . "
note that " sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki " is a tentative name ; researchers always called it by different names such as " sumiyoshi jindaiki " and " sumiyoshi-jinja shrine jindaiki . "
after takashi tanaka strongly recommended use of the title " sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki , " this name was commonly used .
three years later , in 0000 , " sumiyoshi taisha jindaiki " was designated as an important cultural property .
** furthermore , as of august 00 , 000 , the signatures of eight people such as tsumori no sukune yanushi were added as proof of the genuineness of " jindaiki . "
according to these signatures , the document was written in 000 , but this has been questioned for a long time .
** they were not however direct citations , and in fact , quite often they were modified or summarized , or sometimes unique stories were inserted to show the originality of the book .
** for example , in the section on the age of the gods , myths included as apocrypha in " nihonshoki " were selected instead of mythologies introduced in the body of that book .
these selected mythologies resembled those contained in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) .
sumiyoshi sanjin is also known as sansho okami or sangunshin .
** in the cited part on emperor chuai , his father yamato takeru no mikoto was called emperor ( yamato takeru no mikoto however never became an emperor in " kiki " - kojiki and nihonshoki ) .
also , emperor seimu was called grandfather , and he supposedly supported his grandson ( emperor chuai ) to become an emperor .
** the most famous story in " jindaiki " was about empress jingu in which there was a notation that she and sumiyoshi okami ( the great god of sumiyoshi ) secretly had a relationship and later became husband and wife .
this story is often referred to in relation to empress jingu .

** chusei nihongi ( a set of medieval japanese myths )
** background
** major myths
** worship of ebisu ( japanese god of luck )
** ama no murakumo no tsurugi sword
** dairokuten mao and amaterasu omikami
** toyouke no okami ( grand divine toyouke )
** later stage
** in chusei nihongi , it is often the case that shinto deities described in the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) and the nihonshoki are identified with buddhist devas and many types of celestial buddhas .
also , even in cases where shinto deities are not identified with buddhist devas or celestial buddha , the influence of buddhism can be observed in the interpretation of mythologies .
there are no integrated and systematized documents about chusei nihongi because they are described in many books about the study of waka poems , war chronicles , histories of temples and shrines etc . , but the plentiful variety of chusei nihongi are preserved .
** in the medieval period , buddhism permeated all levels of society and sought abstract but rational logic , although occultism remained .
** according to " taiheiki " ( the record of the great peace ) , hiruko ( a deity in japanese mythology ) can be identified with nishimiya daimyojin ( shinto-buddhism great human god of nishimiya-jinja shrine ) .
it is said that this theory was narrated by kanekazu urabe of the urabe family , a family that had made a profession out of interpreting the " chronicles of japan " for generations .
** a similar version is also found in the " tale of the heike , " whereby atsuta myojin ( shinto-buddhist human god of atsuta-jingu shrine ) orders sumiyoshi daimoyojin ( shinto-buddhism great human god of sumiyoshi-jinja shrine ) to chase dogyo and kick him to death .
** in the " shasekishu " ( collection of buddhist stories ) , the following episode is introduced as a tale heard from a shinto priest of ise-jingu shrine .
** when creating the nation of japan , amaterasu omikami discovered the impression of the seal of vairocana buddha in the sea and rummaged through the seabed for the impression with her sword .
** a drop fell from the sword at this time .
amaterasu omikami turns mao away , snapping , " i won ' t chant the name of sanpo ( 0 treasures of buddhism : buddha , sutras and priesthood ) and allow them to come closer to me . so go home ! "
to keep this promise , ise-jingu shrine prohibits buddhist monks from visiting the shrine and requests followers to use metaphors when uttering buddhist words , but followers remain sincerely true to sanpo stealthily deep in their heart in reality .
** incidentally , " tsukai sankei-ki " ( records of buddhist monk tukai ' s pilgrimage ) reads that it was izanagi and izanami who made a promise to dairokuten mao .
** it is pointed out that this episode formed the foundation to the exclusion of amaterasu omikami from kishomon ( sworn oath ) for a certain period in the kanto areas because " she is the goddess who tells a lie . "
** ise shinto itself was built on the shinponbutsujaku theory ( buddhist devas and types of buddha are other forms of shinto deities ) , antithesis of the honji-suijaku theory ( shinto gods are locally-adjusted forms of buddhism devas and types of buddha ) .
** toyouke daijin was an important deity for the imperial family , but there was also a possibility that it was a dangerous deity who may endanger the uniquely sacred position of the imperial family , for example due to the emergence of powerful clans who worshipped toyouke daijin .
** chusei shinwa , meanwhile , was discarded as implausible superstition and scarcely paid heed to throughout the early modern times .
recently , however , research on chusei nihongi has progressed in the fields of mythology and history , in addition to traditional study from the viewpoint of japanese literature .
in the field of literature , chuse nihongi has been redefined as an ideological experiment that figured on the establishment of high-level metaphysics equal to buddhism based on the existing system of japanese mythologies .
in the field of history , chusei nihongi is reevaluated as a good approach for the system of the dynasty state to reorganize the spiritual world of the warrior class and others , who acquired buddhist-like rationalism .
** senkyoshi ( the office of indoctrination )
** " senkyoshi " was one of the government offices of japan in the meiji period .
** on november 00 , 0000 , senkyoshi came under the jurisdiction of jingikan ( department of worship ) .
** on may 0 , 0000 , senkyoshi of dai , chu , and sho with sho and gon , respectively , were renamed hakushi of dai , chu , and sho with sho and gon .
** on april 00 , 0000 , senkyoshi was discontinued .
** scholars of japanese classical literature and confucianism were employed as government officials of senkyoshi .
however , almost no achievement was made due to the following problems .
** there were serious differences of opinion among jingikan and senkyoshi regarding policies , contents , and methods of teaching .
the school conflict led directly to the conflict among officials .
** jingikan and senkyoshi were not authorized to perform teachings on their own based on its power or the number of officials , and therefore in fact no specific policy could be enforced without the permission of daijokan ( grand council of state ) .
** as it was prior to haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) , jingikan did not have power to execute administration to localities ( domains were substantially independent states ) .
** bureau of shrines and temples
** bureau of shrines and temples was one of the bureaus of the meiji government .
** the bureau took charge of all administrations relating to religions , including shrines and temples , and new religions such as tenrikyo and kurozumikyo .
** in 0000 after kyobusho ( ministry of religion ) was discontinued , the bureau came under the jurisdiction of the prewar ministry of home affairs ( japan ) .
** in april 0000 , the bureau was divided into bureau of shinto shrines and bureau of religions .
temples , christianity , and new religions were placed under the control of the bureau of religions .
** bureau of shrines ( jinja kyoku )
** the bureau of shrines was one of the bureaus of the meiji government .
** the bureau was established in the prewar ministry of home affairs ( japan ) .
it took charge of administrative matters relating to shinto shrines , shinto priests and shinto priesthood .
** on april 00 , 0000 , after the bureau of shrines and temples , the ministry of home affairs was discontinued , the work was divided into the bureau of shrines and the bureau of religions .
in other words , the ministry of home affairs was reorganized to establish seven bureaus in the ministry , add bureau of shrines to bureau of areas , and rename bureau of shrines and temples as bureau of religions .
** the bureau ' s staff included one director , one secretary , one investigator , two engineers , one clerk and two assistant investigators .
** on november 0 , 0000 , the bureau was discontinued upon the establishment of jingiin ( institute of divinities ) .
** yuiitsu shinto myoho [myobo] yoshu
** " yuiitsu shinto myoho [myobo] yoshu " ( compendium of the doctrines of the one-and-only shinto ) was written by kanenobu urabe , but it is supposedly a fake edition made by kanetomo yoshida , who made a pretext of an ancestor .
** it describes matters of yuiitsu shinto in the form of questions and answers .
it is said to be the primary scripture of yuiitsu shinto .
** shinto shusei
** " shinto shusei " was written by mitsukuni tokugawa .
it is a collection of similar items of shinto .
** it includes the first volume of genealogy through the twelfth volume of ichinomiya ki yamatohime no seiki .
** the introductory notes say ' largely this book excludes the heretical doctrine of ryobu shugo ( dual compromise ) from beginning to end and returns the doctrine to the right path of yuiitsu sogen ( the one and only shinto as origin and foundation ) . '
** hachiman gudokun ( exegesis of hachimanshin legends for the ignorant and children )
** classification
** contents
** first category books
** the second category books
** " hachiman gudokun " is a history of temples and shrines that narrates the miracle and divine virtue of hachimanshin ( shinto god of war ) , which is considered to have been compiled in the middle or late kamakura period .
** the word ' gudokun ' refers to ' exegesis for ignorant persons and children ' and , in this case , easy explanations of the divine virtue of hachimanshin for them .
it is unclear who the author is , but it is thought that the exegesis was authored by a shaso ( buddhist priest attached to a shrine ) of iwashimizu hachimangu shrine .
depending on the titles of different kinds of books , it is also known as " hachiman daibosatsu ( hachiman the great bodhisattva ) gudokun " or " hachiman gudo-ki . "
also , it is sometimes called " hachiman gudo-kin " based on the title of the book compiled in the early edo period .
it is also famous as records of mongol invasions .
** hachiman gudokun is roughly divided into two categories , which are conventionally called ' the first category ' and the ' second category ' - despite the shared origin , there is a slight difference between the two .
the date of the first category is considered to be between 0000 and 0000 while that of the second category is said to be around the shoan era ( 0000-0000 ) .
both the first and second categories come in two volumes ( book i and ii ) , but it is also likely that they were originally one book .
** furthermore , the first category is divided into category a and category b , in particular .
the preface of category a features detailed descriptions , whereby the attacks on tsusima and iki provinces by the coalition army of the yuan dynasty and goguryeo are described in detail as the explanation of bunei war , one of genko ( mongol invasion attempts against japan ) .
the preface of category b , meanwhile , consists of abstract contents , whereby there are few descriptions about the invasion to tushima and iki provinces .
** as mentioned above , there is a slight difference between the first and second category books , whose outline is given below .
** they consist of book i and book ii .
the first category books describe invasions by foreign enemies and their defeats in history .
book ii introduces episodes such as buddhist priest eison ' s ( aka ' shien shonin ' ) prayers and the auspicious sign of mongol army ' s retreat during the koan war .
** the first category books are almost the only extant historical documents about the invasions of the mongol army , namely the coalition force of mongolia and goguryeo , into tsushima and iki provinces during the bunei war .
the books explain that the mongol army was often beaten back by the auspicious spells and divine power of hakozaki hachiman .
also , the influence of miracles caused by buddhist priest eison ' s prayers is emphasized in the books .
from this fact , it is pointed out the there is a possibility that the birth of the books had something to do with prizes given by imperial court to shrines and temples for their prayers .
( included in the gunsho ruiju [collection of historical documents compiled by hokiichi hanawa] , first series , jingi - gods of heaven and earth - volume 00 )
** they consist of book i and book ii .
the second category books explain the miracle and divine virtue of hachiman daibosatsu in fourteen chapters , which have doctrinaire characteristics and preach merger with the worship of amida .
** in each chapter , the limitless divine virtue and miracle of hachiman daibosatsu is elucidated .

** koshitsu ( study books about ancient history )
** " koshitsu " is a series of books authored by hakuseki arai , which analyze ancient japanese history .
it comprises four books , which were written in 0000 .
from the books , it can be observed that hakuseki tries to grasp the real and rational picture of ancient deities by regarding them as humans and carefully exploring documents from a historical perspective .
** outline
in the beginning of the books , hokusai elucidates his basic attitude toward studying the kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) and the nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
hakuseki insists that as ancient books use the on-reading of chinese characters , readers should understand the meanings and contents of texts by listening to the sound of letters .
** the body comprises four books .
book i : in the beginning , it is declared that deities are humans , and hakuseki proposes the unique opinion that takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) is identified with hitachi province .
in the ensuing sections , kuni-umi ( the birth of the land of japan ) and birth of deities are discussed , followed by episodes until the ejection of susanoo ( the storm god in japanese mythology ) .
** book iii : this book discusses tensonkorin ( the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess ) and kuniyuzuri ( transfer of the land ) .
** book iv : this book reveals the roots of emperor jimmu .
** influence and value
contemporary confucian scholars such as razan hayashi thought that the origin of japanese people could be traced to the descendants of count tai , king of the state of wu .
meanwhile , shinto scholars such as kanekata urabe , an author of shaku nihongi ( annotated text of the nihon shoki ) , and kanera ichijo thought that deities were the roots of everything in the universe , and that takamanohara was located in the heavens .
** after hakuseki ' s death , the books were sidelined for a while , but their approach to analyzing ritual services and mythologies not as religion but as actual human history was reevaluated .
the books were collected in the library of mito domain , and had a large influence on shundai dazai , sadatake ise , and baien miura .
** linguistic validation
** in later years , however , different opinions on ancient kana orthography were proposed by norinaga motoori .
** yomotsu-shikome
** yomotsu-shikome is a female demon of yomi ( the world after death ) in japanese mythology .
it is also written with the kanji characters ' 予母都志許売 ' .
** izanami ( the female who invites ) made yomotsu-shikome chase izanagi ( the male who invites ) in desire to catch him because he had run away from her , breaking his promise .
when izanagi threw a hair ornamentation made of a vine , it bore bunches of wild grapes .
yomotsu-shikome stopped chasing him as she sank her teeth into them but she started chasing again after she finished eating .
then bamboo shoots sprouted from it and yomotsu-shikome again ate them .
meanwhile , izanagi got clear away from yomotsu-shikome .
** yomotsuikusa ( recurring demon )
** " yomotsuikusa " were demons in japanese mythology , which were said to live in the land of the dead .
it is also written with the kanji characters ' 黄泉戦 . '
** when izanagi ( the male who invites ) fled at the appearance of izanami ( the female who invites ) , who had become an inhabitant of the land of the dead , izanami grew angry and set the 0000 yomotsuikusa demons after him .
izanagi , arriving at the starting point of yomotsu hirasaka ( the slope that leads to the land of the dead ) , situated at the border between the land of dead and the land of the living , picked three peaches from the peach tree growing there .
then , he threw the peaches at the yomotsuikusa and dispersed them , according to the myth .
** haitei no yashiro shrine ( shrine of the dethroned emperor )
** haitei no yashiro shrine was located on a knoll in shimogyo ward , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
** summary
the shrine is on the east side of fushimi kaido road leading to inari with two small shrines facing south .
it is said that one enshrines emperor junnin , imperial prince toneri and imperial prince sawara , and the other enshrines empress jingu , empress inoue and imperial prince osabe .
according to a couple of theories , the knoll was a mausoleum of emperor chukyo ( dethroned emperor kujo ) and the divine spirit was enshrined in the shrine , or it was a grave of imperial prince toneri or fujiwara no sanetomo .
it was also called tsukamoto shrine since the round burial mound was enshrined .
in january of 0000 , the divine spirit of haitei no yashiro shrine was enshrined together with the wakamiya hachimangu-jinja shrine in gojo-zaka , kyoto city .
** yasakani no magatama ( comma-shaped jewel )
** the yasakani no magatama is one of the three sacred treasures of the imperial family , along with the yata no kagami ( the eight-span mirror ) and the ame no murakumo no tsurugi ( the sword ame-no-murakumo , literally " heavenly sword of assembled clouds " ) .
usually written as ' 八尺瓊勾玉 , ' it is also written with the characters ' 八坂瓊曲玉 . '
** it has been handed down as a large magatama ( a comma-shaped bead ) or a magatama connected to a long strap .
the kanji character ' 尺 ' ( shaku ) is used to express the phonetic sound of ' saka ' in ' yasakani . '
the original meaning of ' saka , ' however , means ' 咫 ' ( ata ) which stands for a unit of length used in ancient times .
there is another theory that the origin of the term is ' iyasaka , ' meaning happiness and prosperity .
the character used to represent the sound of ' ni ' of yasakani is ' 瓊 ' which means ' red orb . '
the jewel is sometimes referred to as ' ji ' ( a sacred jewel ) .
when the jewel is combined with the sword , together they are referred to as ' kenji , ' meaning the sacred sword and the sacred jewel .
there is a theory that the jewel symbolizes the moon ( yin or negative ) in contrast to the yata no kagami , which symbolizes the sun ( yang or positive ) .
** according to japanese mythology , the jewel was made by tamanooya when iwato-gakure ( the hiding of amaterasu omikami , the sun goddess , in the heavenly rock cave ) happened , who was the deity from which tamasuri no muraji descended .
along with the yata no kagami , the jewel was hung on a sakaki ( species of evergreen sacred to shinto ) , held reverently in both hands by the god futodama .
later on , it is said that the jewel was given to ninigi ( the grandson of the sun goddess ) during the ' tensonkorin ' where he descended to earth in order to rule the country .
** at present , the yasakani no magatama is said to be enshrined together with the sword in the kenji no ma ( hall of sacred sword and jewel ) , situated beside the bedroom of the emperor in the gosho ( imperial palace ) .
** kannabi
** summary
** the meaning of kannabi
** examples of usage of the term " kannabi "
** mt . kannabi in izumo no kuni fudoki ( the topography of izumo province )
** kannabi refers to a sacred area in mountains or forests where a deity dwells or hides .
kannabi also includes natural objects such as rocks ( meotoiwa ) and waterfalls ( nachi no taki ) with distinctive characters where a deity is believed to reside .
therefore , kannabi is also the general term for himorogi and iwakura .
** the object of worship in shrine shinto today is yashiro , and it is not called kannabi .
shrine shinto is said to originate in a primitive religion that arose spontaneously in japan and is derived from the ancient shinto that involved worship of nature and the dead , and elements of both sources still remain today .
although many shrines today display shimenawa ( a sacred rice-straw rope ) as the object of worship , there are also sacred trees , rocks , forests , or even lakes and waterfalls within or outside the same shrines as the object of worship .
it means that nature exists as the object of worship in addition to the main enshrined deity .
some old shrines have no building , main hall or hall of worship ; they enshrine the natural kannabi as the enshrined deities .
** as part of shinto as animism , kannabi is an embodiment of appreciation , awe and respect for nature .
in addition , kannabi represents a sacred area where a deity resides , or a border between tokoyo ( the eternal world of the dead ) and utsushiyo ( this mortal world ) .
in some cases , kannabi means the barrier to restrict coming and going between tokoyo and utsushiyo , or it represents a tabooed land .
** in terms of environmental preservation , kannabi is also notable as a place that preserves unspoiled nature .
** there are several kanji combinations for kannabi , including 神名備 , 神南備 , 神名火 , and 甘南備 .
** in the topography of izumo province , four mountains called " kannabi " are described .
different combinations of kanji are used for " kannabi . "
** mt . kannabi ( 神名樋野 ) in ou county - presumed to be mt . chausu-yama in matsue city .
** mt . kannabi ( 神名火山 ) in aika county - it is generally believed to be mt . asahi in matsue city .
** mt . kannabi ( 神名樋山 ) in tatenui county - presumed to be mt . obunesan in izumo city .
** mt . kannabi ( 神名火山 ) in izumo county - presumed to be mt . bukkyozan in hikawa town .

** hitsuki shinji consists of total 00 volumes including 00 main volumes and 0 supplementary volume .
it is also called ' hifumi shinji ' ( ひふみ神示 or 一二三神示 ) .
** the historical backdrop of hitsuki shinji
the photo was taken when he was young .
konoe served as the prime minister for 0 terms , the 00th , 00th , and 00th .
ghq named him as a class-a war criminal , but one day before the date of his summons , he took poison and committed suicide .
** fuchi , a chinese traditional fortune-telling to ask spirits about god ' s will , is a kind of automatic writing .
the members of shushi kyoyokukai , who studied the ancient history of japan and kiichi ogawa , an army major general and others participated in it .
the spirit kuninotoko tachinokami , who would later possess hitsuki shinji , appeared at that time , and that was the start of it all .
however , at that time , the spirit introduced himself as ' hitsuku no kami ' or ' ame no hitsuku no kami , ' not kuninotoko tachinokami .
they said ' konoe is weak-kneed and useless . '
they continued ' this could just destroy japan . '
they also said in a stormy atmosphere ' we would like to ask the spirit about god ' s will and depending on the answer , we are willing to kill konoe . '
however it was avoided without any incident by tenmei ' s wise judgment .
the spirit answered ' don ' t do that . '
though hitsuki shinji was not decoded enough at that time , some of the military officials seemed to believe and sanctify it .
** hitsuki shinji finally came down
** according to tenmei , when he was taking a rest after giving his appreciation at ame no hitsuku-jinja shrine , he experienced the automatic writing phenomenon .
because he had a lot of spiritual and spirit medium experiences , he thought instantaneously that it was a sign of automatic writing when he had an acute pain in his right arm .
normally he had been able to stop automatic writing by his will , but at that time , the more he tried to stop , the more pain he got in his right arm and he couldn ' t stop .
** this was the divine revelation that was later called hitsuki shinji and it was the important day of the appearance .
when the writing was finished , the pain in his right arm was gone magically .
since then , every time the revelation was received , he had pain in his right arm and after finished writing the pain was gone .
** what were written at that time are the first and second chapters of volume ' uetsu , ' the first volume of hitsuki shinji .
** the original text and interpretation of hitsuki shinji
the original text that tenmei was made to write automatically first at the shrine office of makata-jinja shrine was as follows :
0000re00hon0re ㋹-no 00-no ma00-no ㋹-no chikara wo ara0su 00reru '
it is considered to be interpreted as follows :
fuji was haretari nihonbare . ' ( fuji is perfect and the weather is perfect . )
kami no kuni no makoto no chikara wo arawasu yo to nareru . ' ( the world will show the true god ' s power of the god ' s county . )
hitokuro aruga kono kuro wa mitama wo migaite oranuto kosenu . ' ( you will have one more hardship which you cannot go over without improving your spirit . )
konoyo hajimatte nido to nai kuro dearu . ' ( it is the biggest hardship that the world ever has . )
** it is interpreted as follows :
prepare for it by improving your mind , spirit and body constantly to survive . '
you will not survive without improving yourself . '
beginning with those chapters , the revelation had been written for 00 years from 0000 until 0000 , two years before tenmei ' s death .
the reason why hitsuki shinji is mostly written in numbers and symbols is told by the spirit himself in the revelation as follows :
** numbers are often used as scripts by holy spirits . '
it is because numbers have more hidden true meanings than other scripts . ' ( chapter 00 of volume jishin )
in heaven we often use numbers to communicate with each other . '
in heaven our words are true , so we can tell tens of thousands of words in only one word . ' ( chapter 00 and 00 of volume ' constellations ' )
what is interesting is that famous swedish psychic e . swedenborg wrote the same thing in his book about touring heaven as ' in heaven people always use numbers . '
also in chapter 00 of volume ' ame ' it is written as follows :
this is the only revelation that shows fundamental ki . '
i ' ll tell everything about the three thousand world . '
listen calmly so as not to miss . '
** in the chapter 00 of volume ' kiwame ' it is written ' this revelation is being given to gods , the dragon king , inhabitants of heaven , celestial beings , spirits and people . '
** the three thousand world principle
** hitsuki shinji covering very broad and many descriptions features a description in chapter 0 of volume ' ogon ' ( gold ) as follows :
the existing religions in japan are only for japan . '
but the three thousand world principle is the basis of the whole world and not just a teaching . '
so , it described the revelation as neither religion nor teaching .
therefore it often differs from the faiths and teachings of existing religions and also often denies them .
** it says that whoever hits you on the cheek , offer him the other also for peace , but clean your mind and look carefully . '
it is not nonresistance . '
you will be hit if you have something to be hit in your mind . '
if you are sincere , a raised hand will be put down . '
listen carefully and understand . '
you will never hit infants smiling and approaching you . '
that is nonresistance . '
the world is one family and at peace . '
don ' t be silly to offer your left cheek . '
** some people consider this chapter unconvincing , because there are some parents in the news who abuse and kill their children .
** eating is also a joy . '
eat right foods . '
you ' ll have more pleasures and will flourish . '
eating bad foods badly will make you worse . '
it is the same for everything . '
people are children of joy . '
not children of sin . '
why don ' t you take the joyful way ? '
** on the other hand , it warns against eating much and eating meat as follows ( complementary chapter of volume winter ) :
you will have better luck by controlling your eating and by devoting . '
also you ' ll recover from illness . '
i ' m telling you , half of the amount that you currently eat is enough . '
try the hifumi way of eating , which is far and near . '
you will have better luck and recover from illness and beam with happiness . '
you may say that if such a way cured illness and brought good luck , no one would suffer , but it is just logic . '
it is not good that you are all talk . '
you are like a blind and deaf person with no education , when you are all talk . '
don ' t eat four-footed animals . '
it will be cannibalization . '
i ' m telling you , animals are born to plants . '
people should eat grains and vegetables . ' ( chapter 0 of volume hekigyoku )
while it warns against eating meat , it also says as follows .
when you eat meat , offer it to god once first and receive it from him . '
by doing that , they become god ' s foods . '
this way you can eat anything . ' ( chapter 0 of volume amatsu )
** the representative of ' a way of life ' is the following description . ( chapter 00 of volume fuji )
** making it clear for people , both your body and soul belong to god . '
you can consider it something given from god . '
this way you will know how to keep your body . '
it will become clear when you consider that when you are sleeping at night , you are returning your body . '
improving your body and soul means treating them as god ' s most precious things and god ' s container which you are keeping for him '
he also says as follows ( chapter 0 of volume hitsuki ) :
when you wake up , give thanks to god that you have the life for the day and pray to flourish by the will of god . '
god will tell you what to do one day at a time . '
don ' t worry about tomorrow . '
just be mindful . '
don ' t worry unnecessarily . '
** he also talks about marital relationship as follows ( chapter 00 of volume spring ) :
** love is to be cultivated . '
husband and wife must take care of each other at the risk of their lives . '
conjugal love doesn ' t exist simply . '
it is something to be built by yourselves '
it is to create by yourselves . '
you will see the preciousness in it . '
you ' ll see the joy in it . '
he also says as follows ( chapter 00 of volume gold ) :
if your home is not at peace , it is because your wife is overstepping her position . '
if a wife pays due respect to her husband , she will have every luck . '
he says further as follows ( chapter 00 of volume gold ) :
rely on your wife and rely on your husband . '
then you will find your religious way . '
you will mature . '
the cave will open . '
you will see clear fuji . '
he says that a committed relationship of husband and wife is important as the foundation of religion as follows ( chapter 0 of volume moonlight ) :
don ' t have marital quarrels . '
it is caused not only by your husband . '
it is caused not only by your wife . '
both of you are seeing yourself in each other . '
understand well . '
** hitsuki shinji includes many descriptions about the spiritual world especially in volume ' jishin ' and volume ' ryuon ' which are mostly about it .
among those , here we show a run of the items of descriptions which are related with this world of us .
** the spiritual world in a broad sense is divided roughly into the spirit world , which is divided into heaven and the spirit land , and the astral world which is divided into the positive world and the negative world .
** in heaven celestial beings are living , in the spirit land angels are living , in the positive world positive spirits are living and in the negative world negative spirits are living .
** most supernatural events are caused by responding to the astral world which is linked most deeply to the human world , so you have to be careful .
** in communication with an invisible place , the more advanced communication causes the weaker and more suggestive physical response .
the lower-grade spirits are living in the nearest place from this world , therefore humans respond to them strongly and can see them as plausible , so you have to be careful .
** don ' t forget that human body does not respond to higher-grade spirits immediately and only responds through different stages .
** higher ones are transmitted to spirits on the same wavelength of each person ' s mind and expressed through the sympathies of those spirits .
** you will find it by observing carefully that a medium possessed by a lower-grade spirit acts patronizingly , behaves and speaks domineeringly , orders , asserts and calls himself a holy god ' s name .
** angels who have special missions sometimes come down to the lowest spiritual world to communicate with humans specially and give instructions to humans .
also sometimes a spirit of an angel comes to a mother body to be born as a human .
in a degenerate age , a lot of angels are born in such a way .
** apart from angels with special missions and human spirits , taking japan as an example , mainly spirits of long-nosed goblins , hermits , foxes , raccoon dogs , cats and others can possess humans .
** you have to be careful because many animal spirits change themselves into spirits of human ancestors and attempt something .
animal spirits can know about human ancestors , because they can learn immediately what the spirit of their target human body knows .
** it may be incomprehensible that animal spirits use human words , but it is , for example , just like they enter someone ' s home and just use the household belongings there .
even animal spirits and other spirits can use human words to some extent when they are responding to a human .
they can speak japanese when they are responding to a japanese and speak english responding to an american .
** basically lower-grade spirits and animal spirits can respond to a human , but cannot enter inside the body .
however , if the response is strong , it sometimes looks as if they enter inside a human body .
** exceptionally , human spirit and animal spirit replace each other .
if that is the case , it can be considered as entering inside a body .
for example , a fox spirit that just looks like a fox is easy to identify , but spirits who have ever committed wrong acts change themselves into other appearances in line with each time , so it is difficult to find out .
** don ' t believe it blindly even something that you hear as god ' s words , when you feel it suspicious .
even if you receive it as god ' s words , you have to judge it by yourself .
** also some human spirits who misunderstand that they are living in a higher-grade spirit world , often speak with confidence when they respond to a human .
when they tell receivers about a world which humans don ' t know with confidence , it is often difficult to judge if it is true and makes receivers embarrassed .
** hermits belong to the astral world , no matter how higher-grade he looks .
because they have their religious law in the hermit world .
there is no religious law in the spirit world .
true religion has no law .
religion with law is going to die .
however there are beings like hermits also in the spirit world .
** there are spirits with dragon body ( does it mean dragon king ? ) both in the spirit world and the astral world .
it is wrong that dragon body always belongs to the spirit world .
** when a spirit of an ancestor appears , he/she probably has a favor to ask .
human body seldom responds to higher-grade spirits who have already purified .
** spirits of ancestors practice using human bodies in this world .
also people have deep interchanges and connections with their ancestors in the spiritual world .
** lower-grade spirits and animal spirits tell you something for nothing like ' drunkards ' .
you have to handle their demands judging carefully without accepting it at face value .
** seeing and hearing spiritually often cause mistakes .
with hearing spiritually you can hear even if you cover your ears .
** seeing with the forehead is important .
seeing in the forehead doesn ' t cause any mistakes and makes a good judgment .
also body responds to evil spirits in the back and neck first and feels concentration and energy around ' the pit of the stomach . '
** because some mediums and ascetics perform miracles and act insanely , common people are often deceived .
those are all acts of lower-grade spirits .
** holy spirits perform no miracles .
higher-grade spirits have a good attitude .
** don ' t look down on any spirit , even if the spirit is a lower-grade one .
if a receiver looks down on a spirit , the receiver will be looked down on reflexively by the spirit , so receivers need careful consideration .
especially it is a delicate case when the spirit is related to illness .
it is important to treat any spirit with love at all times and try to lead any spirit to a better way .
if you accept a wrong demand of a spirit to recover from your illness , you will have a double setback after a temporary cure .
** evil spirits do not consider themselves evil .
** spiritual common sense is developed by revelations , sacred books and experiences .
also advanced scientific books serve as a reference .
** an idea which comes straight from the spirit world is the mainstream .
an idea from or through the astral world is outer stream .
** spirits who know well about the human world are those who left this world recently or animal spirits which have lived on earth for a long time or those who have ever possessed a human .
** divine protection is unrecognizable for humans .
recognizable protections are those of lower-grade spirits or evil gods .
even in case of evil gods , a protection of their head is unrecognizable for humans .
** japan has a japanese guardian god , china has a chinese guardian god , other countries have each country ' s guardian gods .
** 00% of the people today have a connection with the astral world , so you need to observe yourself carefully and reconsider it .
** 00% of spirits who appeal to this world through mediums are evil .
it will be more in the future .
** none of those spirits who call themselves a major god ' s name like ' amaterasu omikami ' ( a sun goddess ) can be any good .
those who are being possessed by such spirits are all boasters and suspicious .
** sometimes spirits from the astral world say something right and good , but it is just saying .
it is like a bad person who is just saying goodness .
** you may think that if it is good words , even evil gods can tell those , but that is just twisted logic .
true valuable words take on power immediately when mind , words and acts are consistent with each other , but when those are not consistent , no words have power .
as ' yes ' sounds differently when it is said happily or unhappily , you will find if it is false words by listening calmly .
** every human only can pray to a god who is suitable to his/her own mind .
to your evil mind , only an evil god will respond , even when you pray to a fine god .
in contract , even if you pray to an evil god , proper love , joy and good will in your mind can make a good god appear and evil god leave .
** when people are possessed by an evil god , they often think that they are possessed by a great god .
it is because of their superior feelings like a long-nosed goblin .
** split personality is caused by some different possessions .
also crowd psychology is caused by temporary spirit possession at the time .
** it is completely wrong that spirits know everything .
** people continue to have the thoughts of when they die and each person will live in a suitable world to each thought .
those who see this world as heaven will go to heaven and those who see this world as hell will go to hell which they create by themselves in their thoughts .
** divine self is your original guardian deity and spiritual self is your spiritual guardian deity .
also astral self is your spiritual guardian deity with vice spirit .
original guardian deity is a joy of god .
** because human body is a component of the most bottom part , a physical movement always occurs after a spiritual movement .
** what happened in heaven also happens in this world certainly .
however , depending of the situation of this world at the time , it happens earlier or later .
sometimes it happens in a different order .
** acts of celestial beings and angels are reflected in acts of humans and in contrast how humans show their freedoms and abilities is also reflected in heaven and the spiritual world .
as japan and other countries are different , the reflections of each country in heaven are also different .
** waiting for badness ( natural disaster and unhappiness etc . ) is an evil mind .
when you are expecting when and where those happen , you are being manipulated by a devil .
** a notice from god and the end of the war
** in 0000 , it was just after his resignation as the temporary shinto priest when us military fire bomb hit the main shrine and his life was saved .
the fact was written by minori okamoto as what she heard directly from tenmei in her book " why did hitsuki shinji come down to tenmei okamoto . "
** in chapter 0 of volume ' uetsu ' ( written in 0000 ) , it is written as follows ( in the original , germany is written as 卍 and italy is written as 一十 ) :
' don ' t expect germany as well as italy . '
all the unified countries in the world will come together on to the country ㋹ . '
do you still think that the current way is right ? '
japan will almost collapse once . '
everyone will think once that there is neither god nor buddha in the world . '
tokyo also will return to the original soil once . '
be prepared . '
what god says happens definitely . '
** also in chapter 0 of volume ' matsu ' ( pine ) written in 0000 about two months before the end of the war , it says as follows :
people in high positions will be all prisoners of war . '
it is almost dawn . '
at the break of dawn , everything will be clear . '
it is darkest before the dawn . '
don ' t panic . '
in this way , it is mentioned clearly at this point that the war will end and the leaders ( politicians in high office and military officials at the head ) will be arrested as war criminals and be taken into custody .
as mentioned above , it is said that many soldiers of those who stopped themselves from committing suicide , knew about the description .
the revelation also includes chapters that point out the recovery after defeat in the war , the development of the economy and mental decline of japanese people .
in chapter 00 of volume ' ame ' written in 0000 , it says as follows .
those prisoners of war are not finished yet . '
they will be back , regain and repeat it again . '
in chapter 0 of volume ' umi ' written in 0000 , it also says as follows .
after they come out , they will do the same thing , but they will be already empty and only able to make a crooked work . '
don ' t be bothered by such a thing . '
it is said that it refers to the release of the prisoners .
also it is said that it refers to the mentally collapsing society with many feckless people while recovering after the war .
it is considered that it refers to the recent ' bubble economy ' and the collapse .
it may also refer to the world wide depression which comes only once or less in a century , caused by the subprime mortgage crisis of lehman brothers in the us around 0000 and 0000 .
** the descriptions about the future
** kuninotoko tachinokami and the previous prophets
in chapter 0 of volume ' hikari , ' he says as follows .
here and there in the world , gods appeared inform people of the large-scale washing of the world as i had arranged . '
help each other , everyone . '
it is considered therefore that there were arrangements and approaches of this spirit throughout the ages .
as for coming future events and how to deal with them , the spirit says as follows :
you won ' t find what to do anywhere except here , even if you search around the world with gold sandals . '
so reform yourself and call on me . ' ( chapter 0 of volume matsu )
the gods know that the world will turn over and return to the world of mythological ages . '
here and there in the world gods exist to inform of that . '
but the last thing is known only by me , this god . ' ( chapter 00 of volume shimotsu )
also he says as follows ( chapter 0 of amatsu ) :
don ' t be ants on sugar . '
it says that not all holy spirits know all about the coming events in the future .
before the dawn , possessed people throw the world into confusion without control , but it is just a play for a little while . ' ( chapter 00 of volume constellation )
it is described that such confusion will be only temporary in a passing moment .
** large-scale washing of the three thousand world and big mountain pass
the revelation says that the world was reconstructed 0 times already in the past and the coming reconstruction will be the 0th .
it also says that this will be the last time .
because those past 0 reconstructions were all done only in this world , it hasn ' t been reconstructed fundamentally and turned back .
it is written in chapter 00 of volume ' matsu ' as follows .
it has been reconstructed already before , but those were not the reconstruction of the three thousand world . '
therefore clouds remained in each world , which grew up to evil to spoils people and even gods have been ignorant about that . '
also in chapter 0 of volume ' amatsu ' it says as follows :
the previous reconstructions were just a plaster which turns back soon . '
this time it will be an unprecedented reconstruction which hasn ' t been told yet either in writing or orally . '
it will be reconstructed not only this world but also the spirit world , therefore no other spirits but us don ' t know about that . '
so it is described here again that the biggest disaster will occur all over the three thousand world , which only some holy spirits know .
** also it is described about the reconstruction as follows ( chapter 00 of volume water ) :
reconstruction means to wash everything in the spirit world , the astral world and this world immaculately . '
it will be reconstructed perfectly this time for sure . '
it will be reconstructed by the will of god . '
it will make the world in the light of god . '
in many chapters it is written that the coming reconstruction will make the world in the light of god beyond imagination .
** the sign
in the revelation it is written that there will be some signs before large-scale washing of the three thousand world and big mountain pass .
first will be found an abnormal phenomenon in the sky that multiple ' suns ' appear which should be one normally .
also the ' moon ' will be abnormal and the color will turn ' red ' and the sun will turn ' black ' and the sky will also turn red .
also it will start with a military attack from the north .
it is described as follows :
when you will be attacked from the north , it will start the end of this world . '
there will be not only a sun anymore but two , three , four suns . '
it will be the end . '
folks , the end of this world will be the beginning of the god world . '
i also inform gods of this . ' ( chapter 00 of volume fuji )
the moon will turn red , the sun will turn black and the sky will turn the color of blood as well as the rivers . '
people will get down on all fours or stand on hands or writhe for some time . ' ( chapter 0 of volume shikin )
other than above , it describes an abnormal change of the sky as follows :
when the evening star comes to the east , it will start finally . '
be aware of abnormal changes in the sky as i ' m telling you over and over ' ( chapter 00 of volume matsu )
also it is written as follows ( chapter 0 of volume dawn ) :
be aware of abnormal changes in the sky . '
i ' m telling you it is not always true that spring comes after winter . '
it can snow in summer . '
people ' s evil will gather , by which unknown insects and worms appear in the sky as well as on the ground . '
it is also written ' when you see an abnormal change in the sky , be aware that something abnormal will follow also on the ground . '
it will be coming finally . ' ( chapter 00 of volume amatsu )
so it is described in some chapters of the revelation that it abnormal changes will be seen in the sky and on the ground .
also it is written as follows ( chapter 00 of volume shimotsu ) :
be aware of the dates of 0 , because it is approaching . '
the day and month of kanototori ( the 00th of the sexagenary cycle ) will be good . '
be careful if cherry blossoms bloom in winter . '
it says that abnormal phenomenon of season like cherry blossoms in winter and snow in summer will be also strong signs .
** the big mountain pass
as mentioned above , in the revelation it is described that a major war and natural disasters will occur after the signs .
as for the war , it is described that allied forces consisting of many countries will come against japan .
also it is written in the revelation that natural disasters will occur simultaneously .
in chapter 0 of volume ' fuji ' it is written as follows :
allied forces consisting of the us , england , germany , italy and russia will come against the country ㋹ . '
be prepared . '
however you won ' t know what to do first and then . '
it is described that the military forces such as the us , england , germany , italy and russia will attack japan .
as for natural disasters , it is written in chapter 00 of volume ' shimotsu ' as follow .
the world will be thrown into utter confusion in a blink of an eye as if heaven and earth turn each other upside down . '
so i ' m telling you again and again . '
it will be too late to prepare after it comes . prepare now . '
it continues further as follows ( chapter 0 of volume iwato ) :
it is wrong for you to think that this cave will open only after wars and natural disasters . '
it will not be so easy as wars and natural disasters . '
you ' ll be too surprised to say a word , so improve your spirit soon not to fear anything . '
it is the fear not for your bodies , but for your spirits . '
you won ' t be able to imagine the war and maelstrom of spirits , so you need to ask god . '
therefore you have to improve your spirit to be able to be possessed by god . '
it is not a possession of long-nosed goblins , foxes and raccoon dogs around here . '
it is a possession of god . '
it means that what to fear is not a war and natural disaster or physical fear but a spiritual disaster .
also in another chapter it is described as follows :
people are afraid of war which is just a human war . '
what are you afraid of ? '
what is more fearful is evil spirit in your mind . ' ( chapter 0 of volume fuji )
it is written here again that what is to fear is actually that of spirit .
in the revelation it is described about the coming natural disasters as follows .
** the world will roar and in some places the land will become sea and the sea will become land . ( chapter 0 in volume uetsu ) ( chapter 00 of volume kunitsu )
** it will be a large-scale washing with major earthquake and fire rain . ( chapter 0 of volume shikin )
** it will show more or less how fearful fire and flood disaster will be . ( chapter 00 of volume fuji )
** heaven and earth will be mixed for a time . ( chapter 00 of volume fuji )
** heaven and earth will roar and turn each other upside down . ( chapter 00 of volume uetsu )
** gales will blow , tornadoes will break out from the ocean , fire rain will fall , earthquakes will occur and rumbling mountains will breathe fire . ( chapter 00 of volume fuji )
** and finally mt . fuji will start to move . ( chapter 00 of volume uetsu )
** earth will turn as well as heaven . ( chapter 00 of volume goyo )
** because it was during the war at that time , it was hard to obtain alcohol .
it is said that tenmei liked alcohol very much .
however it seems that they were unable to drink due to the family ' s reason at that time .
** it seems that she brought out a bottle of rice wine without any permission as if she was the owner and offered it to tenmei .
tenmei said later that she had encouraged him to drink while she had also been drinking in a natural and nice manner .
after that he was treated a lot of food in her luxurious house .
** therefore he left the original text and even threw away a part of it .
it was his acquaintance in omoto ( a religious community ) ' shin yano ' ( the wife of yutaro yano , an army colonel ) , who found the importance of the revelation first and let tenmei know it .
** after that , yano encouraged and led some psychics and shintoists to establish a study group to decode the revelation .
the revelation was decoded gradually .
** aside from yano , another person who found the importance of the revelation was ' hogen , ' a temporary shinto priest of hachiman-jinja shrine at that time just like tenmei .
hogen was also an army colonel , therefore many soldiers ( especially those of the army ) knew about hitsuki shinji .
it is assumed that when hogen worked for hachiman-jinja shrine , he probably saw the moment tenmei was made to write the revelation automatically and was impressed by the situation and the atmosphere .
also minori wrote in her book that the revelation wasn ' t scattered and lost , thanks to hogen .
** ( it is assumed that the original text remained after the fair copy disappeared )
** tenmei who was basically a very small eater , ate less - only a rice cake or an apple in a day - for several days before the revelation came down .
however he was fine and felt very good .
** the spirit says about it as follows :
be empty , tenmei . '
drop your sense of self . '
it is hard for me to possess you . ' ( chapter 00 of volume kunitsu )
tenmei , clean up yourself more and more and more . ' ( chapter 00 of volume ogon )
** in chapter 0 of volume ' shimotsu ' is described the appearance of kuninotoko tachinokami as follows .
that is an appearance of the spirit at an activity . '
don ' t make a show of it . '
also in chapter 0 of volume ' amatsu ' it is written ' i have been living in an original body , so i don ' t show it even to tenmei . '
** according to the revelation , social unrest has started in the spirit world first , not in the human world .
in chapter 00 of volume ' nme ' ( volume ume [plum] ? or unmei [fate] ? ) it is described as follows .
it has been confused first in the spirit world . '
the human world needs to have a determination to set the world aright and to open the cave by yourselves , which will make a continuing perfect world and open the cave . '
it says that the efforts from the human world are important .
also in chapter 00 of the same volume it says as follows .
depending on the efforts , also human can reach a certain level of spirit which can be offered advice by god . '
** it is best to improve yourself . '
** tokusen shinmyocho
** tokusen shinmyocho ( also read jinmyocho ) is a commentary on ' engishiki jinmyocho ' ( the register of deities of the engishiki )
compiled by kyobusho ( the ministry of religion , meiji government ) , it consists of 00 volumes .
the compilation team appears to have included such kyobusho officials as hiroshi kurita , kiyonori konakamura , sugimura kosugi and yorikuni inoue , but no precise details are known as the relevant documents were destroyed by fire ( as explained later ) .
** history of compilation
history of the preceding period
refer to kindai shakaku seido ( the modern shrine ranking system ) for more details .
** compilation
as the regulations on shrines formulated in 0000 decided the ranking of shrines based on the situation of those days , some shrines among the shikinaisha and the kokushigenzaisha ( shrines appearing in the six official histories ) were not given a ranking ( these are called mukakusha ) .
compilation of tokusen shinmyocho originated in kyobusho ( reconstituted jingikan ) which was concerned about the risk that those unranked shrines might be eliminated .
and on april 00 , they submitted to dajokan a draft notice to be dispatched from dajokan to each prefecture for a survey on the shrines in its jurisdiction .
the ministry of religion assigned the work of compilation mainly to the staff of the shrine and temple section and the historical study section .
since , however , the survey this time demanded to cover much more details than did the shrine survey of 0000 to 0000 , the survey results were not readily been reported back even after the deadline .
besides , despite the ministry ' s repeated urging , a number of prefectures asked for a postponement every time .
** history concerning the publishing
compiled in 0000 , the work was stored by the home ministry , and as it was inconvenient for viewing , a plan to publish it was developed in 0000 .
fortunately the president of koyodo took with him 000 pages of the proofread dies when escaping , and the drafts which had been sent out for printing were also recovered together with its container .
additionally , the original copies seem to have contained descriptions of kokushigenzaisha ( shrines appearing in the six official histories ) as well according to the introductory notes , but they are not found in the presently available book .
** jinjakakuroku ( historical investigation of old shrines )
** jinjakakuroku is the book of historical investigation of ancient temples and shrines , such as shikinai-sha ( shrines listed in engishiki laws ) .
the book , consisting of 00 volumes , was written by tsuratane suzuka .
he began writing in 0000 and finished in 0000 .
** as a result of the circumstances at the time , however , it had problems such as misquotations caused by forgeries included in the quoted books .
it is also found that some parts were left blank to be filled in afterwards .
however , it was highly praised as the most pointed among similar books partly because it contained the text of " kokunai jinmyocho " ( official registers of kami and shrines ) as fully as possible as a reference .
** after the meiji restoration , following the secret instructions of jingikan ( department of worship ) to present the book to the emperor , a clean copy and a duplicate were prepared as the revised and enlarged edition of the original manuscript .

the writer tsuratane died two days before the presentation .

** timeline of state shinto
** state shinto is the name given by historians to the state religion , as well as the religious services , that were established under a policy of the empire of japan from the meiji period ( 0000-0000 ) to the end of the pacific war .
it was also called ' kokutai shinto ' ( national structure shinto ) , ' jinja shinto ' ( shrine shinto ) or simply ' jinja ' ( shrine ) .
** the definition of state shinto also includes shrine administration , which was carried out by the earlier jingikan ( department of divinities ) and kyobusho ( ministry of religion ) before the ministry of home affairs took charge of shrines .
** the constitution of the empire of japan ostensibly stipulated freedom of religion .
the ministry of home affairs ' bureau of shinto shrines took charge of the ' kankoku heisha ' shrines ( a general term for imperial shrines ( kanpeisha ) and national shrines ( kokuheisha ) ) and built new kankoku heisha shrines using public money .
local officials offered wands made of hemp and paper streamers to the gods at the festivals of shrines with the rank of sonsha ( village shrine ) or higher , and it is considered to have been a kind of state religion system .
** yasukuni-jinja shrine is considered to be a symbol of state shinto .
yasukuni-jinja shrine was founded based on goryo-shinko ( a folk religious belief in avenging spirits ) and was at first mainly intended for the repose of souls , but later evolved into a memorial and place to honor the dead .
yasukuni-jinja shrine was the spiritual core for the unification of the people , and made them accept death in battle by deifying the war dead .
furthermore , criticism against this was prohibited and yasukuni-jinja shrine strongly supported the formation of the national polity that deified the emperor .
** at the beginning , all shrines in the country were brought under government ownership and all shinto priests were treated as government officials ( shinkan ) .
however , some of the institutions remained undeveloped and only the priests who served at ise-jingu shrine became shinkan government officials .
the priests of kankoku heisha shrines were assigned official ranks and given ikai ( court ranks ) , medals for merit and so on .
most of them were treated as junior officials , but some were treated as high-level bureaucrats , received a court rank as a special privilege , and a pension system after retirement was also established .
** since freedom of religion was necessary to build a modern state , it was included in the constitution of the empire of japan promulgated in 0000 .
in the showa period , tatsukichi minobe and the bureau of shinto shrines considered that shrine veneration was one of the constitutional duties of subjects , but it was not issued as a formal constitutional interpretation by the prewar ministry of home affairs .
** the following year , 0000 , the imperial rescript on education was issued , pointing out the basics of national morality and state shinto integrated religion , politics and education .
** the building that housed the jingikan , which managed shrines under the ritsuryo system , was burned down in the onin war and the yoshida family and the shirakawahakuo family continued to manage religious services and shrines with their private houses as jingikandai .
in particular , the yoshida family , by the enactment of jisha hatto ( acts governing temples and shrines ) which gave it authorization from the edo bakufu to manage shrines , assumed all the responsibilities .
** starting with the arrival of the black ships , the end of the edo period encountered diplomatic issues .
the imperial court and the edo bakufu offered a prayer in main temples and shrines throughout the country for the expulsion of the foreigners .
also the public , due to a flourishing of the study of japanese classical literature , called for the revival of the jingikan to save the nation in a time of crisis .
** thus , after the bakufu transferred power back to the emperor , the meiji restoration began with a declaration of the restoration of imperial rule on december 0 , 0000 .
** the term ' state shinto ' existed before world war ii and there are some examples of the term or its synonyms being used in assemblies , shinto studies , the prewar ministry of home affairs , and the department of war .
** since the meaning of ' jinja ' is currently changing , , it is usually the case that the term ' state shinto ' is used rather than ' jinja . '
** there is a theory that states that ' state shinto ' is not a religion and another theory that states that it is .
the non-religion theory says that piety is a duty of the people and this duty is one category of morality , therefore piety towards shrines , the army , schools and public offices is not a religion .
the religion theory says this is just sophistry .
** masaharu hishiki said that some religions in the world place little value on expressing doctrine in words , but using the results of religious studies and cultural anthropology , state shinto doctrines can be extracted without difficulty , and summarizes them as follows :
** holy war
- hostile acts by one ' s own country are always right and participation in them is a noble duty .
** eirei ( spirits of the war dead )
- those who die in such battles become gods .
therefore the dead are enshrined .
** honoring
- make them ( the spirits of the war dead ) a model and follow them by learning from them .
** he pointed out that ' the political purpose of mobilizing people for invasion , which was embedded in the doctrine of honoring , was embellished with the religious tricks of the crusade and eirei doctrines . '
some say that the core of state shinto doctrine is the ' idea of the emperor arahitogami ( kami who appears in this world in human form ) ' and the ' idea of an unbroken imperial line . '
** keiichi yanagawa said that ' state shinto had clear doctrines ' and offered the following four .
** the emperor is descended from the gods in an unbroken imperial line going back to the mythical ancestor , amaterasu omikami ( the sun goddess ) , and he himself is an arahitogami .
** as shown in the tenjumukyu oracle and the creation myths in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) and " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , japan is a land of the gods and is specially protected by them .
** japan has a mission to save the world .
invading other countries was considered a holy war .
** from a moral aspect , the emperor is a parent and his subjects are children so following the theory that loyalty to your lord is the same as filial piety , loyalty to the emperor is filial piety .
** yasukuni-jinja shrine was given special benefits , such as tax exemption , a grant of money for religious services , delivery of annual ' donations ' and an imperial donation from the imperial family .
** in the edo period , amidst discussion and criticism , aizu , okayama , mito , choshu and tsuwano domains abolished or integrated shoshi ( small shrines ) and shrines to evil deities .
in particular , mito domain ' s shrine merger policy was called ' hachiman aratame ' ( hachiman-jinja shrine reformation ) .
this movement destroyed hachiman-jinja shrine , which was worshipped by the former governors , the satake clan , and replaced it with kashima-jingu shrine , which was revered by the mito clan .
** in the meiji period , the jingikan adopted a policy of not reorganizing shrines until its investigations were finished .
** in 0000 , the kyobusho ( ministry of religion ) changed this policy and started to reorganize the modern shrine ranking system and butsu-do ( buddha statue halls ) .
** in december 0000 , a ' shrine merger order ' was issued to integrate or abolish shrines so that there was , in principle , one shrine in each town or village .
that same year , the prewar ministry of home affairs carried out a shrine reorganization project that lasted several years .
the reorganization of shrines generally refers to the project that was carried out at this time .
shrine mergers were performed significantly in mie and wakayama prefectures ; 0000 shrines in mie prefecture decreased by at least 0/0 and 0000 shrines in wakayama prefecture decreased by at least 0/0 .
00 , 000 shrines throughout the country were destroyed in the first three years .
the project was almost finished by about 0000 , with the number of shrines greatly reduced from 000 , 000 to 000 , 000 .
** the purpose of the project was to restore the sanctity of shrines as national religious services by abolishing or integrating ruined shoshi and shrines to evil deities .
it also had the effect of streamlining local administration .
** on the other hand , as it greatly affected belief in local guardian gods , many objections were raised .
the folklorist and naturalist , kumagusu minakata , carried on a campaign against it for ten years in works such as " nippon oyobi nipponjin " ( japan and the japanese ) .
** the loss of vast chinju-no-mori sacred forests surrounding shrines is said to have been one of its bad effects .
some say that one of the aims of this destruction was to tap a new source of revenue by selling trees in the woods owned by shrines .
** shrines were built in taiwan , korea , the south sea islands and other territories .
they were originally built by japanese living in the territories for themselves .
** major shrines built in overseas territories include chosen-jingu shrine , taiwan-jinja shrine , nanyo-jinja shrine , kanto-jingu shrine , and karafuto-jinja shrine ( karafuto , the japanese name for sakhalin , was later incorporated into the mainland in 0000 ) .
refer to the shrines in taiwan for details on taiwan .
** in the early meiji period , possession by divine spirits and acts to obtain oracles from that possession , belief in sex gods and so on were rejected as vulgar or superstitious and many folk customs were prohibited .
this meant that , due to intolerant interpretation , religious beliefs such as those of izumo shinto went into decline .
enshrined deities were changed from gods worshipped locally since old times to gods that connected with the imperial genealogies of the " kojiki " and " nihonshoki . "
thus , if a local tradition ceased , ancient deities of the local shrines often became unknown .
** during the process of realizing ' saisei icchi ' as conceived by scholars of ancient japanese literature and culture from the tsuwano school , such as bisei fukuba , the emperor was positioned as ' a kind of religious founder in charge of shinto . '
** many commentaries on ' sanjo no kyosoku , ' such as " sansoku-oshie no chikamichi " ( shortcut to teachings , 0000 ) written by robun kanagaki , were published .
amongst these , there are several instances of ' descendents of the gods are called arahitogami . '
** the manchurian incident was provoked based on ishiwara ' s final battle theory .
** arguments from 0000 to 0000
a raging debate arose in shinto circles over the deities of the shinto jimukyoku ' s shrine in hibiya , tokyo .
however , the ' izumo-ha ' school centered on takatomi senge advocated ' yuken ichinyo ' and insisted that okuni nushi no okami should be added , making five deities .
** it is said that the government considered it impossible to create a system of common creeds for shinto or to control people directly with creeds of the ancient shinto .
** in 0000 , the government decided that emperor meiji and amaterasu omikami should be the enshrined deities when building chosen-jingu shrine in keijo ( japan ' s colonial name for seoul ) .
however , the third head priest , momoki kamo , insisted that ' dangun ' , the ' ancestor of the korean people ' should also be enshrined .
** on august 00 , 0000 , the situation around shinto changed drastically after the defeat of the pacific war .

** animism
** summary
** views of the animism by tylor and marett
** globally universal ' animism which is a primitive religion as a start ' and discrimination of it
** shinto and animism
** concept of shinto
** deities residing in shinrabansho ( all things in nature , the whole creation )
** syncretization of shrine shinto and the ancient shinto with other religions
** animism is a concept that every thing regardless of a living thing or a non-living object has a spirit or a soul .
in the late 00th century , sir edward burnett tylor , an english anthropologist , used the term in his writing " primitive culture " ( 0000 ) and established it .
in japanese , animism is translated as ' hanrei-setsu ' ( all objects have spirits or souls ) or ' seirei shinko ' ( worship of nature ) .
the term derives from a latin word " anima , " which means breath , spirit , and life .
** tylor defined the animism as ' a faith in spiritual beings , ' which is the minimal definition of a religious thing .
he wrote that the notion of god in many tribes reflect a personality ( personification , sense of personification , euhemerism ) .
the state before the animism was called " pre-animism , " and a similar concept was also referred to as " animatism , " " vitalism , " " dynamism , " and so on .
the approach to the study is sometimes criticized to be analogical or evolutional .
** the spiritual view that a spiritual being governs a body or an object ( a concept close to yorishiro [object representative of a divine spirit] in japan ) is commonly present in religions and folkways over the world .
from the european view point that christianity was advanced , the animism used to belong to a primitive and barbarian society .
it can be seen in the fundamental view of the natives in the south pacific ( trobriand islands ) and brazil in the folklore and the cultural anthropology , as seen in " how natives think " by lucien lévy-bruhl .
** the nature worship and the spirit worship ( animism ) are absolutely included , and a concept of the ancestor worship by extension and the shamanism including shamans and fortune-telling are also involved .
** in this point , even the artificial objects are covered including tsukumogami , tumulus for tools , and hari-kuyo ( solemn rite of respect and thanksgiving for broken needles and pins ) , with extremely large variety .
** there were divine services in each occupation , where a household shinto altar was set , a costume was worn , and unique rites were performed at milestones in the process , and many occupations still continue the services in the present day .
** however , there were some distinction such as strong and weak or main and sub , where larger ones ( giant rock , mountain and river ) and long-living old ones were regarded to have a stronger power and valued .
the deities having an idol as a human such as a humanized divinity in japanese myths were also objects of worship , then the age changed to accept the concept that ' these deities govern other deities of shinrabansho . '
** shugendo , which is a mountain worship combining the ancient shinto , buddhism , and esoteric buddhism , and other religions emerged later , and confucian shinto combined with confucianism emerged in edo period .
** however , since the yorishiro is limited within a certain range in the present shrine shinto , the himorogi and the iwakura became tamagaki ( fence around a shrine ) , and now the sacred shrine forest is not treated as a shintai ( sacred object ) any more .
as described above , shrine shinto may be different from the animism in that deities do not reside in everything .
** koten kokyujo
** koten kokyujo ( 0000 - 0000 ) was an institute established in japan for the research and education on shinto .
** consequently an idea has gained strength within the shinto jimukyoku that it would be necessary to establish a new institution which has a wider range of functions and roles of kyuten renshujo ( the training institute of ancient national literature ) .
** later kokugakuin university was established and managed by the institute .
also , nihon university derives its origin from the law school in the evening session of koten kokyujo , and separated from nihon university was kinki university .

** the inbe clan
** summary
** descendants
** the inbe clan ( also called imibe clan ) was a vocation-based group having characteristics of a clan , which existed from the yamato period through the nara period .
** they shunned defilement and devoted themselves to such matters as divine service .
from ancient times , they were engaged in the manufacture of ritual implements and the construction of shrines and palaces in relation to the religious rites in the court .
tamatsukuri ( jewel making ) , one of the ritual implements manufacturing businesses , had gone downhill after the kofun period ( tumulus period ) , which led to the decline of the inbe clan .
amenofutodama no mikoto is their ancestor .
their posterity later used 斎部 ( also read as inbe ) as the kanji characters to express their family name .
having been involved in a battle for power with the nakatomi clan , and failed in gaining predominance over them , the inbe clan gradually declined .
there are cases where ' inbe ' is written as ' 諱部 , ' ' 鋳部 ' or ' 伊部 . '
** there were many people in the clan , who spread across japan .
they were influential in such areas as kyushu , the kii peninsula , shikoku and the boso peninsula .
** incidentally , it is said that awa province of shikoku region and awa province of the boso peninsula ( chiba prefecture ) have phonetically the same name because the latter province was named as such by the inbe clan people of shikoku region when they migrated to it .
the inbe clan spread in such regions as hokuriku ( echizen province ; the eastern part of fukui prefecture ) , sanin ( izumo province , oki province ; oki island of shimane prefecture ) and sanyo ( bizen province ; the south-eastern part of okayama prefecture ) .
** in a popular edition of taketori monogatari ( tale of the bamboo cutter ) , the godfather of kaguyahime ( the shining princess ) is ' mimuroto no inbe no akita ' and the name of the old bamboo cutter is ' sanuki no miyatsuko . '
based on these descriptions , some insist that the author of the tale was a person belonging to the inbe clan , and others point out the relation between the author and the sanuki-inbe clan .
** the oda clan is a branch lineage of the echizen-inbe clan , a shinto priest family of tsurugi-jinja shrine , ( or of echizen-fujiwara clan according to another opinion ) , but they later misrepresented their lineage as having been descended from the kanmu-heisi ( the taira clan ) .
a reference is made to inbe no moritada in the section of april 00 , 000 of ' gonki , ' a diary of fujiwara no yukinari , as a shinto priest belonging to echizen tsurugi-daijingu shrine .
** their clan title was initially obito but they were awarded a title of muraji on january 0 , the 0th year of emperor tenmu ' s rein ( in 000 ) .
then they were awarded sukune on december 0 of the 00th year of emperor tenmu ' s rein ( in 000 ) together with other 00 murajis .
** according to " nihon isshi " ( supplemental history of japan ) , the inbe clan changed its kanji expression from ' 忌部 ' to ' 斎部 . '
it is said to have been based on the request made by shorokuinojo ( senior sixth rank , upper grade ) inbe no sukune hamanari .
although no biography of hamanari has been handed down , some insist that he is the very same person with inbe no hironari who wrote " kogo shui " ( gleanings of old words ) .
** inbe no kuromaro : one of the poets of manyoshu ( the oldest anthology of tanka )

** jinpu is fuko ( a vassal household allotted to courtier , shrine and temple ) donated to a shrine .
** the residents of jinpu served the shrine by paying tax , performing allocated jobs , serving as hafuri ( an ancient shinto priest ) or other posts , and so on .
these residents are called " jinfuko . "
** therefore , provisions for jinpu was made in daijokanpu ( official documents from daijokan [grand council of state] to local governments ) and daijokancho ( official documents from daijokan to buddhist temples ) .
** however , the difference from jinko in the tax system disappeared when it was decided in 000 that fuko should pay all the rice tax to fushu ( in case of jinpu , fushu is the shrine ) .
it was also treated as jinpu .
** in the early heian period , jinko and jinpu , making no actual difference with each other , began to be confused and treated as the same .

ashihara chihoaki mizuho no kuni ( the eulogistic name for japan ; the land of abundant reed plains and rice fields ) , this is the land where my descentant shall reign .
imashi sumemina ( dear my child who carries out the will of the god of heaven ) , take and fulfill the mission given , and be the one to reign .
may you be filled with happiness .
the grace and goodness of the god of heaven shall prosper and last eternally with heaven and earth .
** hokyohosai no shinchoku ( the oracle of hokyo ( sacred mirror ) dedication )
my child , treat the hokyo as you have treated me .
enshrine the mirror at your side as a goshintai ( object of worship housed in a shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity ) of amaterasu omikami .

** others
the passage of tensonkorin ( the descent of the sun-goddess ' s grandson ) recorded in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) also include a similar sentence regarding tenjomukyu no shinchoku .
amaterasu omikami entrusted and told , this toyo ashihara mizuho no kuni ( the land of abundant reed plains and rice fields ) is the land you reign ' .
although the sentences are different from each other , it shares the common context that it is the will of god for ninigi-no mikoto ( grandson of amaterasu omikami ) and his descendants to become the monarch and reign over japan .
it used to be considered that the position was succeeded to imperial family since iwarehikono , the great-grandson of ninigi-no mikoto , accede to the throne as emperor jimmu .
in the prewar period , it was considered as a legal , historical and religious evidence ( see ' unbroken imperial line ' for the reference ) of the emperor being the monarch of japan .
** shinchoku was a concept that received less emphasis , except for nationalistic scholars of the japanese classics , before modern times .
especially during the war period , it was related to kokoku shikan ( emperor-centered historiography which is based on state shinto ) and national policy theory , to be used as one of foundation to support government authorized idea .

sanno no kami was also considered to be a manifestation of buddha .
** sanno ichijitsu shinto
according to sanno ichijitsu shinto , sanno gongen is taken as dainichi nyorai ( mahavairocana ) and amaterasu omikami ( sun goddess ) .

** shintai-zan mountain
** summary
** holy mountain fuji
** such sacred mountains are also called ' reiho ' ( lit . sacred peak ) , and mt . fuji is one of the representative reiho .
passes , slopes and other small peaks were also considered sacred and worshiped as places where deities dwell .
** what typically represents such idea is mountains , and the idea that deities dwell in particularly big unique mountains is known as mountain worship .
mountain worship is found not only in japan but in various parts of the world ; the masai and kiyuku tribes in the southern part of kenya worship mt . kilimanjaro as a mountain where their god abides .
** in japan , kannabi , a holy mountain where deities dwell , is another form of mountain worship .
formerly mountains worshipped as kannabi include ordinary mountains and iwakura ( dwelling place of a god , usually in reference to a large rock ) or iwasaka ( the area a deity sits ) as well as volcanoes and bold mountains with no forests .
today kannabi is said to have become the antetype of tamagaki ( fence around a shrine ) for jinja shinto ( shrine shinto ) together with himorogi .
** this explains that many ancient shrines were originated from the shintaizan ( kannabi ) worship .
this idea is explained by other theories .
** ancient anecdotes about the deities of mt . fuji and mt . tsukuba are recorded in " hitachi no kuni fudoki " ( the topography of hitachi province ) .
the parent deity visited the deity of mt . fuji and asked for lodging , but the mountain deity rejected the request on the grounds that the deity was during fasting .
the parent deity then went to mt . tsukuba , asked the deity of mt . tsukuba for lodging and was welcome this time .
consequently , many people began to gather at mt . tsukuba ; on the contrary , mt . fuji came to be always covered with snow , and people stopped visiting mt . fuji .
** " sarashina nikki " ( sarashina diary ) , a literature work in the heian period , wrote that some people in those days believed the personnel affairs for the following year in the imperial court were determined by the deity of mt . fuji .
** the area of mt . fuji higher than the 0th station is the compound of sengen-taisha shrine except for the climbing trails and mt . fuji weather station .
but no land registration is yet done because the prefectural boundary between shizuoka and yamanashi is still undetermined .
** mt . fuji hongu sengen-taisha shrine

konohanano sakuya bime is also known as the ' deity of fire . '
but according to the legend handed down by mt . fuji hongu sengen-taisha shrine , this goddess is known as the ' deity of water ' that suppresses fire .
when and how the deity of mt . fuji came to be identified with konohana sakuya bime is unknown .
** fujiko ( devotional fuji confraternities ) and fujizuka mounds
in the edo period , climbing mt . fuji for worship became widely popular among commoners .
as a result , commoners came to strongly worship mt fuji , and many fujizuka mounds for worship of mt . fuji from afar were built at various parts of edo .
fujizuka mounds are artificial mounds constructed by filling up earth and were built at places that can command mt . fuji , and sengen-taisha shrine was built atop those mounds .
those mounds were designed to allow people who couldn ' t visit mt . fuji to experience climbing mt . fuji and worship it on a simulated manner .
** in response to the growing popularity of mt . fuji worship , various new religions mixing shintoism and buddhist based on the mt . fuji worship were born in the edo period .
those new religions conducted missionary work in edo and formed fujiko confraternities , and some such groups became too big to be ignored by the edo shogunate government , which eventually announced directives to prohibit formation of fujiko confraternities repeatedly .
for example , the edo magistrate ' s office announced the directive to prohibit fujiko seven times from 0000 to 0000 .
some of those new religions still survived the hard days of the meiji era and are still operating , which include such groups as jikko-kyo , maruyama-kyo and fuso-kyo .

** seii taishogun
** summary
** history
** nara/heian periods
** kamakura period
** later samurai society
** similar shogun positions
** seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) was one of the shogun positions in japan ' s ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) .
it was abolished in the meiji restoration .
** it was one of the names given to the general dispatched to the eastern part of the country from the nara period to the heian period .
also abbreviated to shogun , kubo , taiju , taijuko , gosho , etc .
although there were no posts called seiju taishogun or seiban taishogun , there were the similar posts of seiteki daishogun and seisei taishogun .
from the kamakura period until the edo period , it was the head of the shogunate , a position held by the leader of the samurai families , and became hereditary to his descendants .
although he was formally a retainer appointed by imperial edict , he was in fact the ruler of japan who even held sway over the imperial court , and typically was treated as the king by outsiders .
** ' seii ' means ' to conquer the barbarians . '
the seii taishogun was a general appointed for conquering ' barbarians , ' and led an army in an advance from the pacific ocean side .
a general who led an army ' s advance to the japan sea side was called seiteki daishogun , and one who led an army ' s advance into kyushu was called seisei taishogun .
it is thought that this was an adaptation of the sinocentrism of ' shii ' ( four barbarians ) , ' toi , seiju , namban and hokuteki . '
** in fact , at first it was called ' seii ' but from hoki onward it became ' seito , ' and was again called ' seii ' from 000 on .
the title of shogun is not uniform in the records , with fujiwara no umakai , for example , being ' jisetsu taishogun ' at the time of his appointment , and ' seii jisetsu taishi ' at the time of his return to the capital .
** on july 00 , 000 , otomo no otomaro was appointed seito taishi .
on february 00 , 000 , seitoshi was changed to seiishi .
' shi ' was also called ' shogun , ' and one school of thought says this is the first appearance of a seii taishogun , but the issue gets more complicated .
** below otomo no otomaro was the seito fukushi/seii fukushi , sakanoue no tamuramaro , who was appointed seii taishogun on november 0 , 000 .
tamuramaro brought aterui , of the ezo of isawa , who had fought stubbornly until then , back to the capital , thereby conquering that land .
practically speaking , tamuramaro can be seen as the first seii taishogun .
** in fact , below the seii taishogun were the posts of seii fukushogun , seii gungen , seii gunso , etc .
** at first minamoto no yoritomo was nothing but the leader of the kanto bushidan ( kamakura-dono ) , and did not hold a position under the ritsuryo system .
that is to say that at first he was only the head of a provincial insurrection , the same as taira no masakado .
** under the administration led by the taira family , given that the position of court noble was already very high at the time , court nobles reached the height of their powers when the taira family , part of the taira clan , became court nobles .
in contrast to that , yoritomo worked toward elevating the status of warriors themselves .
with respect to the imperial court , they sought a suitable position in order to establish the independent sovereignty of the warriors .
** yoshinaka kiso , who advanced into the central area and kyoto , took the position called ' seii taishogun , ' which had previously existed .
** the oshu fujiwara clan ruled the northeast region at that time , as it was an area to which the imperial court ' s rule did not extend .
the oshu fujiwara clan secured the position of ' chinjufu shogun ' and called their own residence ' yanagi no gosho ' or ' ryuei . '
ryuei is another name for the shogunate .
this seems to have been the yoritomo government in microcosm .
** in 0000 yoritomo was appointed to ukone no daisho ( udaisho ) and had his own organs of household government approved as government offices .
however , the konoe daisho was required , by the nature of that position , to live in kyoto , and was not suited to moving toward independence in kanto .
then yoritomo resigned from udaisho , and held onto those privileges as a former udaisho .
it is thought that the notion of using the title of ' former udaisho ' for heads of state in the kamakura government was not unheard of .
also , compared to the oshu fujiwara clan ' s chinjufu shogun , it lacked the important , active element of ' warrior ' s self-rule . '
** what yoritomo turned his attention to then was the office of ' seii taishogun . '
as military rule ( regional sovereignty ) , it was the same as the chinjufu shogun .
** yoritomo was not in fact very attached to the seii taishogun post , and indicated his intent to resign 0 years later in 0000 .
also , minamoto no yoriie was his heir and right away was appointed to sakone no chujo , and then saemon no kami , and was proclaimed seii taishogun 0 years later .
then at the time of the hiki yoshikazu incident , the succession of the positions of sotsuibushi and sojito were in question , and the shogun posts were not involved .
consequently , at this stage the shogun post was not an absolute requirement for leadership of the warrior families , and may not have been seen as that important .
on the other hand , the post of shogun was proclaimed first when it came to succeeding minamoto no sanetomo .
** when the minamoto clan ' s shoguns ended after the third one , shoguns from regent families or royal shoguns were installed as puppets and the regent hojo clan held the real power .
** from the kamakura period on , after minamoto no yoritomo took the position of seii taishogun and started the shogunate , the warrior families came to control japanese politics .
along with that seii taishogun was the highest authority of the warrior families and japan ' s substantive sovereign .
although it was originally a post bestowed by the imperial court , actual appointments , except for a time during the new kemmu government , were at the request of the person whose influence placed him at the pinnacle of samurai society .
formally speaking , among the nobles it was recognized that the court was the true government and the shogunate was a temporary government in the provinces .
however , among warrior families that was not the case .
** in the period of the northern and southern courts , akiie kitabatake of the southern court , as chinjufu shogun , was allowed to be called chinjufu taishogun , but it is thought that this was done to put it on a level with and oppose the seii taishogun .
** historical traditions
it was customarily accepted by the warrior families that ' the families that could rise to shogun , leader of the samurai , were limited to those extending from the seiwa genji . '
furthermore , even after yoritomo , there are examples of regent shogun and imperial shogun , so it was not in fact limited to the seiwa minamoto clan .
all this can be interpreted to mean that someone from the minamoto or taira clans , or even from the noble fujiwara clan , could become seii taishogun .
** there are various opinions as to whether or not nobunaga oda wanted to be seii taishogun , but it is not possible to know for sure .
also , there are those who say that hideyoshi toyotomi was not able to become seii taishogun because he lost to ieyasu tokugawa in the battles of komaki and nagakute .
however , hideyoshi was appointed to kampaku , a higher ranking position than seii taishogun .
for that reason , it is possible to speculate that hideyoshi was not interested in the shogun post , and wanted not a simple samurai government , but a new government that would subsumed the nobles .
** also stemming from this came the idea that the minamoto and taira clans , or the minamoto and taira families , alternately take control of political power in japan ( gempei kotai shiso ) .
** in fact , although there is an apocryphal tale that taira no tomomori and mitsuhide akechi were appointed to seii taishogun , there is no historical evidence to indicate so .

** etymology and change in pronunciation
** recent classes of daimyo
** this section describes the details of the edo period , recent daimyo .
** for shugo daimyo or sengoku daimyo , refer to the relevant articles .
** edo period daimyo
** the rank of edo period daimyo was determined by family status , official rank , size of stipend , office , and service .
** beginning with the elder brother of the second shogun , hidetada tokugawa , and second son of ieyasu , hideyasu yuki , was sent to the echizen domain , he placed tokugawa family members as daimyo all of the country .
** this was for the separation of influence and military power .
** the tozama daimyo were the daimyo that joined after the battle of sekigahara , and many had opposed the tokugawa at sekigahara .
the shogunate was very careful about that , actively carried out intelligence gathering activities using spies , and when they feared impropriety or insurrection , did not hesitate to revoke rank .
** refer to shikoseki for details .
** aside from daimyo in charge of provinces , those with 000 , 000 koku were generally not allowed possession of a whole district , and usually held territory around the castle and in patches .
in extreme cases , rule of a single village was divided between two land holders ( aikyu ) .
** daimyo , as a rule , had 00 , 000 koku or more , but the kitsuregawa clan ' s kitsuregawa domain was 0 , 000 koku .
that was because the kitsuregawa clan were descendants of the ashikaga clan .
** daimyo were subject to control by the shogunate through the laws for the military houses and the sankin kotai ( alternate attendance ) system .
other than that , there was a system of assignments called otetsudai , and at the end of the edo period some were ordered to defend the coast , so the daimyo were always in a difficult position financially .
** words associated with daimyo

** the muromachi period dictionary " setsuyoshu " listed the two pronunciations ' taimei ' and ' daimyo , ' the former meaning a shugo ( a major feudal lord ) , and the latter meaning a wealthy person ( the wealthy class ) .
in the warring states period , the distinction by pronunciation weakened , and it is thought that ' taimei ' was common .
the nippo jisho ( japanese-portuguese dictionary ) from the beginning of the 00th century also listed the two pronunciations , ' daimyo ' and ' taimei , ' but there was no clear distinction in meaning , and both were used for major feudal lords .
the pronunciation settled on ' daimyo ' after the beginning of the edo period , and by the kansei era they were solely called ' daimyo . '

** further , as training progressed , the number of hogi who were bureaucrats from the secular class increased and personnel exchanges began to take place more freely .
** around that time , temporary assignments started to become particularly common which subsequently were made permanent positions , however , it was not due to respect for those in the priesthood but mainly for the purpose of offering job satisfaction to court nobles .
** since onmyoji was essential to establishing the code of conduct for both the minamoto clan and the taira clan since the days of the war of genpei , the new shogunate also had a high regard for onmyodo .
** ( it is said that yoshimitsu was planning to make the authority of the chrysanthemum throne his own and his giving an important role to onmyoji was aimed at seizing the responsibility for religious services performed in the imperial court . )
** subsequent to this time , some of civilian onmyoji who were on the constant move with no permanent home were looked down upon as were other homeless rovers .
they were sometimes called ' hakase . '
** additionally , harenaga tsuchimikado , who assumed the post of onmyo no kami after the passing of haruo tsuchimikado , was still a child and was in no position to challenge what had been said on his own initiative .
** seizing this opportunity , in 0000 , the meiji government went ahead and abolished onmyoryo and transferred tenmon and rekizan ( calculation of calendar ) to the university , observatory , or to a section of the navy ( japan ) .
in 0000 , tensha kinshirei ( ban on tensha ) was issued and dissemination of onmyodo was also prohibited among the common people based on the grounds that it was superstition .
** since the meiji government issued the ban , nothing deriving from onmyodo was seen at public functions any more and onmyodo was also no longer in fashion among the people .

it should be noted , however , that only ' senjiryakketsu , ' which was passed down from generation to generation in the tsuchimikado family , has been confirmed to be the work of seimei .

** doman immediately guessed the contents of the chest and excitedly answered , ' 00 large oranges ' but seimei , after performing kaji , quietly said , ' 00 mice . '

** chitoku hoshi ( ? - ? )
** an illegal onmyoji who , while being a monk in harima province , made a large amount of money by using magic and divination .
it is generally believed that chitoku hoshi and doman ashiya may have been the same person since their characters and circumstances were very much alike .
** as onmyodo has become diversified over the years , its rituals have varied .
taking into account their implication on the other religions , since the rituals of onmyodo are still under investigation , it is difficult to discuss them in specific terms .
it is considered that there was a strong influence of the so-called jugondo when onmyodo was first brought over to japan .
ceremonies conducted by onmyoji in the imperial court have been recorded in ' onmyoryo ' of " engishiki . "
additionally , some of the onmyodo ceremonies are outlined in bunkansho written in the middle ages but the religious ceremonies of onmyodo consist of large , medium and small methods that seem to be used depending on the circumstance .
** kuji ( 0 letters )
** a type of spell considered to be used in onmyodo .
it is therefore considered that kuji curse , a gesture of cutting the air 0 times vertically and 0 times horizontally and ketsuin were created separately .
additionally , while the gesture of cutting the air 0 times vertically and 0 times horizontally appear in some scriptures such as taoist scriptures and has existed from long ago , a gesture of ketsuin is not described in those old scriptures .
it is likely that the gesture of ketsuin was added while onmyodo was being adopted by the esoteric buddhism or shugen-do after it was brought over to japan .
** it can be learned from the existing literature that it was used when migatame or henpai was performed .
** kyukyunyoritsuryo '
** it was originally a set expressions meaning , ' execute quickly as prescribed in the ritsuryo , ' which was written at the end of official documents during the han period in china .
originally , ' 急 ' was written with the 口 ( mouth ) shape on the left .

** rikujinshikiban or rikujinchokuban
** identical results to that from performing simple calculations can be obtained by aligning junigessho on the heaven board with junishi on the earth board .
shikiban is also called choku ( the letter ' shiki ' meaning ceremony with the wood shape ) .

** kontengi
** a tool used to detect astronomical variations by observing combinations of movements of stars and positions of guiding stars .
in particular , it was considered that major disasters or extraordinary phenomenon would occur if meteors , which were not supposed to exist , appeared .
** jufu/reifu
** charms inscribed with various patterns and magic words that were supposed to be used by onmyoji .

** taijo shinsen chintaku reifu
** 00 kinds of charms that are also known as ' taijo hiho chintaku reifu ' or ' chintaku shichijunido reifu . '
at present , ' taijo hiho chintaku reifu ' in dozo are believed to be the original form and it is considered that they were brought over in the early middle ages .
they were universally adopted not only by onmyodo but also by other religions such as buddhism and shinto .
the god who controls this reifu is called chintaku reifu shin and was considered to be genten-jotei ( xuan-tian shang-di ) , one of the taoist gods originally .
genten-jotei was the humanized divinity of genbu and the object of the hokuto hokushin faith .
when genten-jotei was introduced to japan , it consequently syncretized with myoken bosatsu and ame no minakanushi no kami whereby having impact on seishin worship .
it seems that onmyodo was more receptive of this reifu with that being the object of seishin worship and bearing the inscription of hakka .
** in recent times , ' chintakureifu ' on which all of 00 kinds of charms are printed is offered in scrolls and enshrined at myoken-gu and reifusha in various locations
in addition , tsuchimikado shinto ' s currently enshrined gods ( saijin ) include taizanfukun , chintakureifujin and abe no seimei with seimei being the principal god .
it is considered that masashige kusunoki and kiyomasa kato were among the devoted followers of chintakureifujin .

** migatame
** an art of self defence in onmyodo .
** uho

** shugodai
** summary
** shugodai who became feudal lords
** shugodai is an official post that was placed under the shugo in the kamakura and muromachi periods .
** in a broad sense it is a kind of daikan , but from the muromachi period on the agents who ruled lands under the direct control of the muromachi shogunate were called daikan , distinct from the shugodai who was the shugo ' s deputy .
** the shugo was often involved in the central government in kamakura or kyoto , and would leave his fief for long periods .
in the case of a shugo who oversees several provinces , he would have had even fewer opportunities to observe those for which he was responsible .
for that purpose the shugo would appoint an agent from among his vassals to carry out government affairs in his stead .
that is the shugodai .
the shugodai would place sub-shugodai to be his own agents , thus making many layers of land governance organization in the shugo ' s fiefs .
** sanuki province kozai clan : tanba province shugodai ; noto province yusa clan : kawachi province shugodai ; etc . ) increasingly often , and as the positions became hereditary , they replaced the shugo as effective rulers .
** furthermore , as the shugodai changed into feudal daimyo , there were more and more daimyo families that sought status on the level of a shugo .
** the prime example of that is the asakura clan .
the asakura clan was in fact a powerful branch of the ashikaga shogun ' s family , and as kokujin were hikan ( low level bureaucrats ) for the shiba clan , who for generations held the top position among the sankanrei ( three deputies ) .
** the shugodai of izumo province , the amago clan , were related to that province ' s shugo , the kyogoku clan , and were appointed shugodai as their chief vassals .
however , in the battles after the onin war , they gave distinguished service and within the kyogoku family cultivated their power and overcame the main family to become feudal daimyo , eventually achieving the status of shugo .
because tsunehisa ' s son masahisa amago fell in battle , masahisa ' s eldest son became tsunehisa ' s successor .
tsunehisa gave his grandson one of the japanese characters from shogun yoshiharu ashikaga ' s given name ( " haru " ) , naming him haruhisa amago , and achieved a promotion to become the shugo ( governor ) of izumo .
** in this way , the position of the shugodai , which was nothing more than an agent of a shugo in the muromachi period , at the opening of the warring states period overtook that of the lords and became one of replacing them .
** on the other hand , even though they succeeded for a while in becoming feudal daimyo , there are many examples of them later being overthrown by their vassals .
the miyoshi clan are the prime example of this .
the miyoshi clan , as important vassals of the hosokawa clan , were shugodai in awa .
** however , even though the miyoshi clan ' s power grew , their household affairs were eventually taken over by their chief vassal , hisahide matsunaga .
** the shugodai of owari province , nobutomo oda , also propped up his lord yoshimune shiba as a puppet shugo , and used him as a justification for his own predominance and expansion of power within owari province .
however , even though the lord eventually opposed him and sought to drive him to suicide , he was blamed by his relative and vassal nobunaga oda for the murder of his lord and overthrown .
** the uragami clan that held power in bizen province were also another family that became feudal daimyo for a while , before they were overthrown by their subordinates in the ukita clan .
the uragami clan had their base in harima province , and as chief vassals of the akamatsu clan who were the shugo over harima and bizen provinces , had served as the shugodai of bizen for generations .
however , at the time of munekage uragami they rebelled against their masters and eventually secured an independent position as feudal daimyo in bizen province .
however , eventually the ukita clan , who were powerful kokujin in the same family , deposed the uragami clan and usurped the rule of that fief .
** kampaku
** kampaku is a post held by a person who governs in the emperor ' s stead .
** it is a ryoge no kan , a post that was not originally specified in the ritsuryo system , and was effectively the highest post among court nobles .
** summary
unlike with the sessho , who exercised full authority as an agent of an infant or invalid emperor , in the case of the kampaku the emperor held ultimate decision making authority .
for the most part , a sessho would go on to become a kampaku .
this is called sekkan politics ( politics run by sessho and kampaku ) .
** etymology
it comes from the words to entrust ( kan ) and to say ( haku ) the emperor ' s words .
the word kampaku has its origins in the tradition followed in early han china where all reports to emperor xuan were entrusted to the powerful statesman huo guang .
a previous kampaku , who has passed on the position to a successor , was called taiko by the tang .
** history
the first kampaku was fujiwara no mototsune , in the time of emperor uta ( 000 ) .
qualification for the appointment was limited to line of regents in the lineage of the eldest son of the northern fujiwara family , who were descendants of fujiwara no michinaga .
the source of that power was in the authority to view documents sent to the emperor from the daijokan and others before the emperor did , called nairan .
consequently , there were cases wherein someone was not appointed kampaku but gained the right of nairan to act as kampaku and grab power - fujiwara no michinaga was typical of this .
on a related topic , the diary that michinaga wrote is now called ' mido kampakuki , ' but in fact michinaga took the post of sessho and never became kampaku .
at the time the discord between michinaga and emperor sanjo while he had nairan became a political issue .
** originally , a sessho kampaku running the government in place of the imperial regime was limited to assistance from a maternal relative because the emperor was an infant .
that is why the sekkan household was established by sending a daughter to be the emperor ' s queen , and having her bear a prince .
because of that , when emperor gosan-jo , who did not have any of the sekkan house ' s blood , came to power , the influence of the sekkan household began to decline .
in particular the cloistered emperor shirakawa brought about the demise of the age of sekkan-centered politics with the start of his cloistered government after giving up the throne .
from the kamakura period on , because political power moved from the court to the warriors , the influence of the kampaku on politics became ever weaker .
however , kampaku was always the highest rank for nobles , had great influence over within the imperial court , and since it turned out a great many queens the kampaku commanded authority and respect in every era .
** as an exception , in the tensho period hideyoshi toyotomi took advantage of the kampaku dispute to be adopted by sakihisa konoe and succeed to kampaku , becoming the first samurai kampaku in japanese history .
when hideyoshi acquired the toyotomi clan , he became the first kampaku that was not from the fujiwara clan or one of the five regent families .
later , in order to realize a samurai kampaku regime ( samurai kampaku system ) from the hashiba clan , hideyoshi adopted his nephew hidetsugu toyotomi and made him kampaku .
however , while hidetsugu was serving as kampaku , government and the household were in the grip of the taiko , hideyoshi , and he later had a dispute with hideyoshi and fell from grace .
the toyotomi regime continued after that , but hideyoshi decided not to appoint a kampaku until his son hideyori toyotomi reached adulthood .
however , after hideyoshi ' s death from the battle of sekigahara on , real power was transferred to the tokugawa family , and the job of kampaku was again given to the five regent families .
later , the toyotomi family was wiped out in the siege of osaka and never recovered the post of kampaku .
** moreover , there were many kampaku who were able to send their daughter to be the shogun ' s official wife ( midaidokoro ) , and there were some who had a certain influence in the shogunate ( motohiro konoe , for example ) .
from the meiji period on , the positions of sessho , kampaku and seii taishogun were abolished , and the history of the kampaku came to an end together with the shogunate .
after that , only the sessho has been revived , designated under imperial household law for only princes and other members of the imperial family to act as an agent in carrying out the emperor ' s official duties , and continues to this day .
** regent
** in many cases , the post is filled by the monarch ' s successor ( e . g . a prince ) , brother , mother , or a maternal relative such as a grandfather or uncle on the mother ' s side .
** japanese regents
the early modern period
** later several members of the imperial family became regents , but under risturyo the post in charge of the regency was not defined .
** at this point , the regent , as the post of one who conducted government in the emperor ' s place , came to be defined as an official outside of ritsuryo .
while the regent carried out ( as an agent ) government in the place of an infant emperor , he also at that time oversaw the emperor ' s major power to manage officials and took charge of appointments and promotion of officials .
** at that time , the myobo and myogyo kanmons ( reports ) were issued regarding the status of the regent .
in the former , ( 0 ) three high level bureaucrats ( grand minister of state and ministers of the right and left ) were heads of the grand council of state , but the regent did not have an official rank .
even without that , the appointment to regent decreed ' service in state affairs , ' so if that treatment was laid out in an imperial decree , it was so .
** from around the time of the 00th century fujiwara no michinaga , except for the period of the kenmu restoration , it became a permanent post .
later , the descendants of fujiwara no michinaga came to be either regent or kanpaku at all times , regardless of their family relationship .
** the two exceptions to this are hideyoshi toyotomi and hidetsugu toyotomi .
** prior to the meiji restoration the regents carried out most of the emperor ' s governmental affairs , such as writing imperial edicts , conferring ranks and making appointments , and their power was nearly the same as that of the emperor .
** the later modern period
in 0000 , based on the imperial constitution and former imperial house act , a system was laid out to put an imperial regent in the emperor ' s place when the emperor had not reached the age of maturity or could not wield sovereign power .
the regent had almost the same authority as the emperor , but did not have authority to amend the constitution or to expand ( amend ) the imperial household law .
from emperor taisho ' s last years in 0000 to his death in 0000 , crown prince hirohito ( later emperor showa ) served as regent .
during that period , crown prince hirohito is also known as sessho no miya .
** a regent system was also created by the constitution of japan and imperial household act enacted in 0000 .
as specified in the constitution of japan , the regent is a position to carry out national affairs in the name of the emperor , and has exactly the same authority as the emperor regarding national affairs .
when the emperor has not yet reached the age of maturity , or due to a serious illness or accident is unable to conduct national affairs , a regent will be placed at the discretion of the imperial household council .
** the temporary agent for national affairs is given as an example of something similar to a regent .
this is a system that was put in place so that national affairs could be entrusted to someone in the event of the emperor ' s illness or accident , without going so far as appointing a regent .
** under the japanese constitution , there has so far been no example of a regent being appointed .
** succession to regent and temporary agent for national affairs proceeds in the following order of adult members of the imperial family .
** crown prince , emperor ' s grandson
imperial princes and males of the imperial family
empress
empress dowager
grand empress dowager
imperial princesses and females of the imperial family
** the fact that women can take the position is different from imperial succession .
as a solution to such a situation , one view is that birth in the royal family should be made a condition for an empress , empress dowager , or grand empress dowager to become regent .
** chinese regents
** in china , in the event that the emperor was unable to perform his duties , there were instances of the imperial family supervising government as national directors .
mostly a prince would be the national director , but in the qing dynasty there were cases of the emperor ' s uncle ( dorgon ) or father ( zaifeng ) conducting government as regent of national director .
also in the various historical dynasties there were instances of an empress dowager conducting governance by women .
** western regents
** in the byzantine empire , there were instances of the archbishop of constantinople , who was the head cleric , filling the post of regent .
also , as with horthy miklos in the kingdom of hungary between wars , sometimes there was only a regent because the monarch was absent .
** kanrei
** kanrei is the name of a post in the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
originally a word meaning to manage/rule an official post or fief , the regent to the kamakura bakufu was sometimes called kanrei .
** summary
originally filling a secretarial role in the management of the ashikaga clan , it started as a steward who administered the mechanisms of feudal rule .
at the time of yoshiakira ashikaga , the second shogun , because of instabilities such as kiyouji hosokawa falling from grace due to internal disputes in the shogunate , yoshiakira briefly conducted direct shogunal rule .
in the period of yoshiakira the role of hikitsukeshu ( coadjustor of the high court ) who administered regional governing authorities was reduced and the power of the stewards was strengthened , with the aim of establishing a centralized governing authority .
** in 0000 , the 00 year old yoshimasa shiba was appointed , and his father takatsune shiba was his guardian .
in 0000 , in the joji incident spurred by the anti-shiba doyo sasaki , the shiba clan fell , and yoriyuki hosokawa , who had the support of doyo and the others , became steward .
it is thought that the transition from steward to kanrei was between kiyouji and yoriyuki .
afterward , the kanrei supervised government affairs , and management of the ashikaga shogun family was transferred to mandokoro ( administrative board ) .
yoriyuki hosokawa fell in the koryaku coup , and yoshimasa shiba was rehabilitated , but even after that the shiba and hosokawa clans were opposed over the kanrei position .
in 0000 , motokuni hatakeyama became kanrei , and after that the shiba , hatakeyama and hosokawa keicho families related to the ashikaga family were appointed in turns .
** personnell affairs and contents that passed assessment were written on kanrei stationary and dispatched to the various provinces .
at the time of the third yoshimitsu ashikaga and the fourth yoshimochi ashikaga , there was a conference system centered around the shukuro ( chief vassal ) , and the position of kanrei was lowered ; and the shiba family first declined , not least because of financial burdens .
the sixth shogun , yoshinori ashikaga , aimed to strengthen the authority of the shogun , so the authority of the kanrei was reduced , and intervened in disputes over inheritence in the shiba and hatakeyama clans , which later contributed to the decline of both families .
** in 0000 , katsumoto hosokawa , who commanded the eastern army , became kanrei .
** however , when masamoto was assassinated by vassals over succession , the hosokawa clan split and declined .
in the 0000s , yoshioki ouchi , nagayoshi miyoshi , sadayori rokkaku and others ruled the shogunate as deputy kanrei , the post of kanrei became merely formal .
then after ujitsuna hosokawa ' s death in 0000 , it in fact came to an end through natural lapse .
** shugo
** the kamakura period
** the muromachi period
** the warring states period
** shugo was a samurai office in japan ' s kamakura and muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and was a military commander and administrative official placed in each ryoseikoku ( province ) .
at the time it was established , the main duty was supervision of the jito in the province .
in the kamakura period it was called shugonin-bugyo ( post of provincial constable in kamakura period ) , and in the muromachi period it was called shugoshiki ( post of provincial constable ) .
** kamakura period shugo are thought to have begun in 0000 when minamoto no yoritomo placed them in each province after raising an army and entering kamakura .
later , as the influence of the yoritomo administration expanded westward , installations of shugonin expanded from the eastern provinces to the western provinces .
** with this the kamakura period system of shugo and jito began in earnest .
it was around 0000 that the distinction began to be made between shugo , a post installed in each province , and jito , a post installed in each manor or kokugaryo district .
it was only after the jokyu war that they were able to get rid of this kind of interference .
** from the middle of the kamakura period on , the hojo clan proceeded to monopolize the post of shugo .
this situation created latent resentment among the other gokenin , and is thought to have been a contributing factor to the demise of the kamakura shogunate .
** even in the emperor godaigo ' s kenmu restoration that came about after the fall of the kamakura bakufu , the system of placing shugo alongside kokushi was left intact .
in fact , because the restoration ended just a few years later , the details about kenmu period shugo are not clear .
** the muromachi bakufu that followed also continued the shugo system .
this was a continuation of the kamakura period ' s tokuso autocracy .
** karitarozeki is the use of force occurring in territorial disputes between warriors , while shisetsu jungyo means to forcibly execute the shogunate ' s decisions in the local area .
based on these , the shugo gained the two rights to intervene in disputes between warriors in the province , and to enforce the law .
** in 0000 , with the aim of procuring military provisions , the right of hanzei , the ability to collect half of the annual tribute from manors/kokugaryo within the province , was granted to the shugo .
the hanzei law of 0000 addressed not only the payment of annual tributes , but also allowed for the partitioning of the land itself , leading to a marked increase in the incidence of shugo invading other manors/kokugaryo .
they also collected tansen and munabetsusen , kinds of taxes , greatly increasing their economic power .
** this movement is called hikanization , but in this way the shugo expanded their local and centralized influence within the provinces , in the realm of land as well as of people .
because this state of the shugo in the muromachi period differs greatly from the strictly military and police powers that the kamakura period shugo had , muromachi period shugo are referred to as shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) to distinguish them .
also , the system of provincial rule by a shugo daimyo is called the shugo-ryogoku system ( the system that a shugo dominates a manor ) .
in fact , a shugo daimyo ' s rule over the fief was not always complete , and there were actually many examples , mainly in the area around kyoto , where the kokujin class refused to become hikan of the shugo .
** by the middle of the muromachi period , the power of the shugo daimyo within the shogunate had grown to the point that the shogunate had come to resemble a coalition government of shugo daimyo .
among the powerful shugo of the time were some , beginning with the members of the ashikaga shogun family , the shiba , hatakeyama and hosokawa clans , and including such outsiders as the yamana , ouchi , and akamatsu clans , who ruled over several provinces .
those shugodai would then appoint a further , assistant shugodai , and the structure of rule took on a two- and three-layered shape .
** one of the privileges of the shugo was ichiji-hairyo , by which they could receive one letter from the shogun ' s imina ( personal name ) .
the shugo were also allowed the social status of shirokasabukuro ( white umbrella bag ) and mosenkuraoi ( literally , tufted saddle cover ; and the shugodai were allowed karakasabukuro ( oiled-paper umbrella bag ) /mosenkuraoi and nurigoshi ( lacquered litter ) .
by being allowed the use of nurigoshi , the shugo and shugodai alike , had their own authority as influential warriors recognized .
especially in the kamakura-kubo ( shogunate ) ashikaga family , among the influential warriors of the kanto region , 0 families received the yakata title and were called kanto hachiyakata .
** from around the time of the onin war , there were increasingly prominent clashed between different shugo ; keeping pace with that was the desire for independence ( kokujin revolts , etc . ) on the part of the kokujin , who were the local lords .
although these movements invited a reduction in the power of the shugo , on the other hand they led to stronger rule over the kokujin by the shugo .
** in this way the muromachi period shugo who succeeded in securing feudal rule , the shugodai who replaced shugo , and kokujin transformed into daimyo ( japanese territorial lord ) in the sengoku period and grew .
that many daimyo in the sengoku period were appointed shugo by the shogunate is evidence of this .
based on this , there are some schools of thought that posit the idea of a warring states period shugo .
** the edo period
** at the end of the edo period , the chief of the aizu domain , katamori matsudaira , went through the imperial court to be appointed by the edo bakufu to the post of kyoto shugoshiki .
** udaijin ( minister of the right )
** summary of udaijin
** udaijin was one of the positioins in daijokan ( grand council of state ) , which was the highest body in the organization of the imperial court .
equivalent chinese posts : right ministry , ujosho , ushokoku , ubokuya , taiho .
the japanese reading is miginooimouchigimi / miginootodo .
he fulfilled a support role for sadaijin ( minister of the left ) , and would carry out the duties of sadaijin when he was unable to do them for some reason .
it is equivalent to an official rank of sho/ju nii ( senior/junior second rank )
** naidaijin ( inner minister )
** important naidaijin
** naidaijin is one of japan ' s official titles .
duties varied throughout history .
** it was a japanese ministerial position that was outside of the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
comes after sadaijin ( minister of the left ) and udaijin ( minister of the right ) .
** an official post in the government of the empire of japan in the meiji period .
established in 0000 .
abolished in 0000 .
** the ritsuryo system
a naidaijin ( also known as an uchinoomaetsugimi or uchinootodo ) was a japanese minister that was outside of the ritsuryo system .
the equivalent chinese posts are daifu , naijosho , naishokoku and naibokuya .
at the level of shonii/junii ( senior/junior second rank )
** the naidaijin would attend to government affairs if both the sadaijin and udaijin were unable to do so for some reason .
although it is ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) , it was recorded that appointments were first made even before the ritsuryo system was established .
it is thought to have started with nakatomi no kamatari ( fujiwara no kamatari ) , who was appointed to naishin by three successive emperors , kotoku , saimei and tenchi from 000 , was appointed to naidaijin just before his death .
** later , although there were several instances of naidaijin being placed for special reasons , it is thought that naidaijin as a permanent official started with fujiwara no michitaka in the middle heian period .
** abolished at the time of the meiji restoration .
in the azuchi-momoyama period the greatest daimyo ( japanese territorial lord ) under the toyotomi administration , ieyasu tokugawa , was appointed .
after that , too , successive seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) , such as iemitsu tokugawa , were appointed .
** although fujiwara no fusasaki , fujiwara no nakamaro , and dokyo did not take on the post of naidaijin , they are listed as persons who entered posts with similar duties .
** meiji period
at first , right after dajokan ( great council of state ) system was abolished , it also served as a post for dealing with the former daijo-daijin sanetomi sanjo .
entering the showa period it replaced the genro ( elder statesman ) , fulfilled a major role in recommending prime ministers , and held power not only in the imperial court , but in the government as well .
in emergencies when naidaijin was absent , the chairman of the privy council would temporarily become naidaiji and assist the emperor .
there was an example of this when , immediately after the february 00 incident , privy council chairman kitokuro ichiki became naidaijin and resigned the same day .
** also , as a special case , imperial prince sadanaru served as naidaijin ( 0000-0000 ) .
** after the unconditional surrender in 0000 , it was abolished by the general headquarters of the supreme commander of the allied powers ( ghq/scap ) .
** for a list of successive naidaijin , refer to office of the inner minister .

** omandokoro
** omandokoro
it is an abbreviation of okitanomandokoro
** usually , omandokoro refers to hideyoshi toyotomi ' s mother , naka .
more detailed information will be provided in this section .
** naka
** omandokoro was a woman who lived from the sengoku period ( period of warring states - japan ) through the azuchi-momoyama period ( 0000 - august 00 , 0000 ) .
her formal name was naka , and she gave birth to hideyoshi toyotomi , hidenaga toyotomi , nisshu and asahihime .
** career
** in 0000 , she was born as the daughter of kanesada seki who was running a forging shop and also in the samurai class in gokiso-mura , aichi-gun , owari province ( aichi prefecture ) .
the seki clan was a family who was engaged in the business of forging swords .
it is also thought she was born 0000 .
** she got married with yaemon kinoshita ( shokichi kinoshita and yasuke nakamura ) who was serving as the head of conscripted foot-soldiers for nobuhide oda and she gave birth to nisshu-in and hideyoshi .
meanwhile , after her husband died in the war ( actually , died of a disease ) , she got married with masamori mizuno ( chikuami ) who was serving as doboshu ( government post ) for hidenobu .
she gave birth to hidenaga and asahihime during that period of time ( father of hidenaga and asahihime is believed to be yaemon or chikuami . )
** later years of omandokoro
upon the promotion of hideyoshi to the kanpaku in 0000 , she was called omandokoro .
in 0000 , hideyoshi advised ieyasu tokugawa to carry out the joraku ( going to kyoto to seize power ) , but it was unsuccessful , and he sent asahihime for his legal wife and omandokoro as a hostage to okazaki , mikawa province .
as a result , ieyasu agreed to the joraku , and omandokoro was able to return to osaka in a month or so .
** hideyoshi called for his mother to live and stay in the castle when he became the owner of nagahama-jo castle , and it is well known that he always cared about his mother throughout the rest of her life .
omandokoro got along with kodai-in very well , who was hideyoshi ' s bride .
according to various tales , she was a wise and smart woman .
** after the preceding death of her children , asahihime and hidenaga , she died in 0000 at jurakudai ( hideyoshi ' s residence in kyoto . )
she was eighty ( or , seventy seven ) year old .
** kubo ( shogunal representative )
** the later years
** kubo of the ashikaga clan
** a nickname for the shogun
** especially in the late muromachi period , the term " kubo " was used as the title of the ashikaga shogun family who were dominant in exercising governmental authority of the shogun .
the title of kubo was called " kubo go . "
** history
the creation of ' kubo go ( the title of kubo ) '
in china , the chinese character for " ku " in the word " kubo " included the concept of " private , " while in japan this character was used to mean the integration of the nation and its people .
in japanese , the meaning changed such that the concept of " public " did not include " private " referring to the field that a nation should deal with , and it became the opposite of " private . "
this concept appears in japanese phrases such as " goko gomin " ( to share the total harvest of rice between public and private , 00% each ) or " koshi kondo " ( to mix up public and private matters ) .
** after the late heian period in which private fiefs like shoen ( manor in medieval japan ) were remarkably spreading , the term " kubo " was used to emphasize the national sovereignty .
** this rule is said to have been introduced by yasumori adachi , who carried out a reform of the shogunal administration under the banner of the shogun from the imperial family and tokimune hojo , the regent for the shogun .
** " kubo " in the muromachi bakufu
however , takauji was not unreservedly happy about the title of kubo because the term " kubo " carried the strong connotation of the court or the court nobles .
takauji refused to accept the title of kubo , saying that he could not put on armor if he got it ; however , once the title was bestowed on him , it was diffiicult to recall it ; thus , the title was tentatively left to takauji .
** subsequently , the title of kubo was not employed even at the time of yoshiakira ashikaga , the second shogun .
however , after the time of yoshimitsu ashikaga , the third shogun , the title of kubo was positively used as an honorific for the shogun .
after the shogun family called themselves kubo , motouji ashikaga , who was kanto kanrei ( the shogunal deputy for the kanto region ) at first , began to name himself kamakura kubo .
since then , the title of kubo had been handed down for generations by the shogun who headed the shogunate and by the families of the ashikaga clan in kamakura who called themselves kamakura kubo .
** in addition , the uesugi clan and the hatakeyama clan who had been shitsuji ( the shogun ' s assistant ) were moved up to kanto kanrei .
some say that kenshin uesugi succeeded to the position of kanto kanrei , and that ujitsuna hojo and ichimasu takigawa adopted the title kanto kanrei some time later .
** in the edo period , the title became firmly established as another name for the shogun who possessed absolute power ; when people referred to kubo , they almost always meant the tokugawa shogun .
** when the leader of the samurai family who headed the shogunate was appointed " seii taishogun , " his honorific title of " uesama " changed into " kubosama " ; the term " kubo " strongly indicated that " kubo " was a representative of the court .

** hirashima kubo ( hirashima gosho , awa kubo )

** the court rank system of china
** the court rank system of silla
** the court rank system of ryukyu
** in the court rank system under the ritsuryo system , four ranks called honi ( court rank ) ( the history of japan ) were separately set up for the court rank to the imperial princes .
at present , it is also a rank of honor under the constitution of japan , which is bestowed every year upon the deceased who have done distinguished services .
** " kani " ( the official rank ) , which is often confused with the court rank , is referred to as " the official post and rank " and differs from ikai .
** the court rank system introduced from china with other political and administrative systems has developed independently in japan .
the twelve-cap court rank system established in 000 was the first that imposed a ranking among government officials .
** after 000 , even gods were given ranks ( see shinkai , ranks granted to shinto gods ) .
** by connecting the court rank with the official post ( the official rank system ) , the court rank system placed the right person in the right post regardless of heredity or power , and also avoided the hereditary transfer of the official post .
the system that the emperor used to impose a court rank also concentrated the authority and power in the hands of the emperor , which led to the establishment of the political system that placed the emperor at the top .
** the official post was determined by the court rank , and restrictions on costumes were imposed according to the court rank .
it was stipulated that those who ｗere of fifth rank and above were provided with " iden " ( rice fields provided depending on the court rank ) .
** under the ritsuryo system , ' the nobility ' were referred to as persons of fifth rank or higher , and granted the privilege of stepping into the imperial court .
in contrast to ' the nobility , ' those who were of sixth rank or lower to no rank were called ' jige ' or ' jigenin . '
** under the imperial court and the new meiji government , the court rank and the official post were conferred on the deceased in the recognition of services done in their lifetime .
the posthumous conferment of court rank and the official post were called " zoi " and " zokan , " respectively .
e . g . shoshii ( senior fourth rank , posthumously conferred ) ; naidaijin ( minister of the center ) , posthumously conferred
** the reading of " 正 " in " 正o位 " is not " sei " but " sho , " and the reading of " 従 " in " 従o位 " is not " juh " but " ju . "
in addition , the reading of " 三位 " is not " sani " but " sanmi , " ; " 四位 " is not " yoni " but " shii " ; " 七位 " is not " nanai " but " shichii . "
** " oni no sei " was a system that guaranteed a certain level of court rank for descendants of high-ranking nobles .
it literally means the conferment of the court rank owing to one ' s ancestors .
the conferment of the order of merit and the posthumous court rank were applicable to the system of " oni . "
" oni no sei , " which was based on the chinese ritsuryo system , had a narrow range of qualification , and the rank given was high compared with the chinese one .
** imperial families and shoo
the child of an imperial prince would receive the rank of jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade )
the child of a prince without the title of " shinno " would receive the rank of jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade )
the legitimate child of a fifth-generation prince without the title of " shino " would receive the rank of shorokuinojo ( senior sixth rank , upper grade )
( an illegitimate child was downgraded one rank . )
** subjects
the legitimate child of a subject holding the rank of ichii ( first rank ) would receive the rank of jugoinoge
hereinafter , the rank gradually decreases ;
the legitimate child of a subject holding the rank of jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) would receive the rank of juhachiinojo ( junior eighth rank , upper grade )
( an illegitimate child was downgraded one rank , and an illegitimate grandchild was downgraded another one rank . )
** when a high-ranking official was sentenced to punishments less than exile , his sentence was always reduced by one degree ; he could expiate his crime by giving up his title , which is , " kanto . "
the commutation of a punishment by a dismissal of an official post or demotion was common because the official posts became important in the middle heian period .
it was also generally accepted that only those who were sani ( courtier without post ) or hikan ( a person of the lower rank ) could escape imprisonment and expiate crimes by giving up official posts or by offering copper coins .
** the court rank system was originally designed for the purpose of avoiding the hereditary transfer of an official post , setting the court rank based on ability and giving the appropriate official post for the court rank and level of ability .
however , it contained such a condition to allow the hereditary transfer of the official post from the start : the establishment of " oni no sei " .
for all these reasons , the court rank system became an empty formality in the early heian period , resulting in that some high-ranking nobles monopolized the hereditary transfer of the official post .
** on august 00 0000 according to the old calendar , the court rank system was temporarily abolished because of the introduction of " kanto " ( the government official rank system ) .
** in 0000 , the " joijorei " ( regulations concerning the conferment of court rank : imperial ordinance no . 00 0000 ) was enacted , and the court rank system was restored .
after the " joijorei " was enacted , the rank was divided into sixteen grades from shoichii to juhachii . ( including " joijorei " )
for the ranks from jushii upwards , treatment was accorded corresponding to peers .
persons of juichii ( junior first rank ) were treated corresponding to the title of prince ; persons of shonii ( senior second rank ) , marquis ; persons of shosanmi/jusanmi ( senior/junior third rank ) , count ; and persons of shoshii/jushii , baron .
** in 0000 , " ikai rei " 位階令 ( the decree concerning the court rank : imperial ordinance no . 000 0000 ) was enacted .
so , the court rank system has benn maintained as a system of awarding honors along with the conferment of orders and medals ( japan ) .
unlike the conferment of decorations , persons who has lost or abandoned their nationality are deprived of the rank , and foreigners are not entitled to the conferment of court ranks .
the court rank was conferred on only civil subjects ; the imperial family were not entitled to the conferment of court ranks . ( those who lost their status as a member of the imperial family enjoyed the conferment of court ranks . )
" sochitsuryo " ( a bureau of the minister of the imperial household ) was a section in charge .
** accordingly , the aspect of awarding honors was more emphasized .
** after the second world war , the conferment of court rank was suspended for a while along with the conferment of decoration .
then , it was restored in 0000 , limiting the recipients to the deceased .
so , at present , it has strong implications of praising and commemorating the achievements done by the deceased .
the eligibility criteria for the recipients are almost the same as that of the conferment of decoration , but the details differ , such that the eligibility criteria depend on what kind of achievements done .
those who served long in public office ( members of the diet , government officials , fire officers , members of a fire brigade , teachers , etc . ) are often conferred court ranks .
** a diploma of court rank is issued to certify the conferment of the court rank .
the following contents are stated vertically in the diploma of court rank .

** sadaijin ( minister of the left )
** list of sadaijin
** the minister of the left was a government post in the daijokan ( grand council of state ) , the central administrative body of the imperial court .
the chinese names were " safu , " " sajosho , " " sashokoku , " " sabokuya , " and " taifu . "
the japanese readings were " hidari no oimouchi gimi , " and " hidari no otodo . "
it was equivalent to the official rank of shonii or junii ( senior or junior second rank ) .
** as its another name , " ichi no kami " ( the chief administer ) indicated , it was like the head of taikaku ( cabinet ) that oversaw all functions of daijokan .
as daijo-daijin ( grand minister of state ) , which was above sadaijin in rank , was not a permanent position , it was not appointed in the absence of a qualified person ; therefore , in such a case , sadaijin was the top rank in daijokan .
daijo-daijin was later regarded as an honorary post , and sadaijin bacame virtually the supreme leader of daijokan .
** in that case , udaijin ( minister of the right ) acted as a substitute .
** daijo-daijin ( grand minister of state )
** overview of daijo-daijin
** the japanese reading is " omatsurigotonomaetsugimi . "
equivalent chinese posts are shokoku , daijosho and taishi .
** summary
with no particular duties , people such as an emperor ' s teacher ( top instructor ) were appointed , so it was not always filled , only when an appropriate person was available .
for that reason , it was called a " sokketsu post " ( " ketsu " means " absent " ) .
also , it was the only one exempted from danso ( indictment for illegal activities ) by the danjodai ( board of censors ) .
a post at the rank of shoichii ( senior first rank ) , juichii ( junior first rank ) .
** beginning in 000 , during the reign of emperor tenchi , it was abolished with the meiji period ' s sanetomi sanjo ( 0000-0000 ) as the last .
** that is when , on june 0 , 000 , emperor koko invited scholars sugawara no michizane and okura no yoshiyuki to give their opinions of the authority of daijo-daijin .

** as the influence of the northern house of the fujiwara clan extended , for the 000 year period from fujiwara no yoshifusa ( served 000-000 ) until minamoto no masazane ( served 0000-0000 ) , the fujiwara clan maintained a monopoly .
** the six daijo-daijin from samurai families were taira no kiyomori , yoshimitsu ashikaga , hideyoshi toyotomi , ieyasu tokugawa , hidetada tokugawa , and ienari tokugawa .
** investiture of daijo-daijin while living was rare , but as a posthumous honor , it was sometimes given to sessho and kanpaku , to maternal grandfathers of the emperor , and to seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) in the edo period
when the post of daijo-daijin was given after death for meritorious service performed in life , it was " zo daijo-daijin " ( the grand minister , posthumously conferred ) .
** nyoin ( a close female relative of the emperor or a womwan of comparable standing )
** nyoin who were not members of the imperial family or their spouses .
** " in " means a retired emperor , and " nyoin " means a woman who gets treated in a similar fashion .
** object of imperial proclamation
** originally , an empress stopped being treated as one ( imperial consort ) when she became a nun .
** ( however , in the case of princess shoshi , some say that she was made nyoin as a means to open up the empress position so there could be a new empress )
** among these there appeared many princesses who were given a title as a prelude to territorial succession , and some were given the title the same day as they formaly became princess/jugo .
the power of the princesses given huge manors was great , and hachijoin , senyomonin and princess kuniko were examples of those who used wealth to get a look at politics .
** later , from the muromachi period to the early edo period , both investiture of the crown ｐrincess and princesses came to an end , as a result of which there was a long period in which only the emperor ' s birth mother became nyoin .
after that , even though there were calls to revive the nyoin in regard to the treatment of yoshiko nakayama and naruko yanagihara ( birth mothers of emperor meiji and emperor taisho , respectively ) , there was a lot of opposition and it did not come to fruition .
** titles
** unlike an ingo ( a posthumous title ) given to an emperor or retired emperor , the name of a nyoin ( hereafter nyoingo ) was given during her lifetime by ingo-sadame ( imperial decree ) .
however , after taikenmonin in 0000 , it became standard practice for nyoingo to be given regardless of place of residence .
** the title of empress dowager
** one form of nyoingo was the mon-ingo that came from kinri ( the imperial palace ) gates .
the first example was fujiwara no shoshi , who was originally named after the ridai , but jotomonin , who was the mother of the two successive emperors , was cited as a good example ; this became the ingo for a majority of all nyoin .

** rokuhara tandai ( an administrative and judicial agency in rokuhara , kyoto )
** summary
** " rokuhara tandai " is a job title in the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
they are the branch offices that the bakufu established in the north and south of rokuhara , kyoto by reorganizing the existing kyoto shugo ( kyoto military governor ) after the jokyu war in 0000 .
they are called rokuhara tandai kitakata ( northern chief of rokuhara tandai ) and rokuhara tandai minamikata ( southern chief of rokuhara tandai ) .
** as the postwar settlement after the jokyu war , the territories of the court nobles and samurai who supported the retired emperor gotoba were forfeited and redistributed to the gokenin ( an immediate vasal of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods ) as rewards .
these were shoen ( manor in medieval japan ) which were not governed by the bakufu until then , and many were in the west where bakufu ' s authority was hard to reach .
as a result of the redistribution , jito ( manager and lord of manor ) were assigned to these shoen as well .
additionally , the bakufu-side had to constantly monitor and control the movement of the imperial court .
** this is how the rokuhara tandai began .
** the tandai was considered the most important post following shikken ( regent for shogun ) and rensho ( assistant to shikken ) , and traditionally , one person each was chosen for kitakata and minamikata from the hojo clan to perform government affairs .
young and promising personnel from the hojo clan were often chosen for tandai , and many were promoted to shikken or rensho after returning to kamakura .
additionally , subordinate organizations pursuant to organizations in kamakura such as hyojoshu ( members of council of state ) were set up under it .
** additionally , in 0000 , the year following bunei battle , the function of rokuhara tandai was further enhanced , and authority for punishing gokenin and the trial system was enhanced .
** meanwhile , the actual binding power for the authority was not necessarily enough in some aspects .
enryaku-ji temple made a protest to the bakufu about this , and rokuhara tandai presented evidence to show there was no negligence on the part of tamekiyo and the subordinate , but the bakufu condemned tamekiyo to banishment to avoid confrontation with enryaku-ji temple .
** therefore , those familiar with the situation , did not favor a post at the rokuhara .
** in 0000 , when the genko war erupted from emperor godaigo ' s anti-shogunate movement , takauji ashikaga , doyo sasaki , and enshin akamatsu responded to the emperor ' s order and attacked kyoto .
thus , nakatoki hojo , the tandai at the time , and others were forced to leave kyoto , and rokuhara tandai vanished .
kyoto city rokuhara elementary school stands now in its location , and there is the rokuharamitsu-ji temple nearby .
** jusanmi
** " jusanmi " ( junior third rank ) is a rank in court ranks and shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) .
** in case of posthumous honor , it was called zojusanmi ( posthumous jusanmi ) .
** jusanmi
under the ritsuryo system , jusanmi or higher ranks were called " ki " ( literally , noble ) or star ranks , and were court ranks for senior kizoku ( noble ) .
when contrasted with kunto ( order of merit ) , it corresponds to kunnito ( order of second class ) , and those with shoshiinojo sangi ( councilor ) and jusanmi or higher court ranks were considered kugyo or kandachime ( court noble ) .
** instead , those who were jushii ( junior fourth rank ) or higher , but not a kugyo , added ' ason ' under their family names and imina .
additionally , when a kugyo ranking sanmi or higher died , the term kokyo was used , as was the case with the imperial family , to describe their death .
furthermore , in later years , they were referred to as ' sanmi-dono ' or ' sanmi-sama . '
** therefore , those who serve as chujo despite being sanmi were called sanmi-chujo ( third rank assistant director ) .
** in the heian period , until taira no kiyomori became the first samurai to become kugyo , the highest rank for both seiwa-genji ( minamoto clan ) and kanmu-heishi ( taira clan ) was shoshii .
** additionally , mochikuni hatakeyama who supported the shogunate as kanrei was also promoted to jusanmi , and there are cases of the rank being granted to powerful members of the ashikaga family .
furthermore , in the late muromachi period , masanori akamatsu , a powerful shugo ( provincial constable ) , was granted the rank , and gradually , dominant daimyo ( feudal lord ) other than the ashikaga clan began to be granted the rank .
in particular , appointment of the rank from the beginning to the middle of the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) includes yoshioki ouchi who prospered as kanreidai ( deputy kanrei ) , motonobu takeda of wakasa province , and yoshisuke ito of hyuga province .
nobunaga oda , who later becomes udaijin also at one time held this rank , and his eldest son nobutada oda ' s rank was jusanmi sakone no chujo ( middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards ) .
after hideyoshi toyotomi , who became the first kanpaku ( chief advisor to the emperor ) from a samurai family , conquered the country , samurai were increasingly promoted to high ranks , and sanmi was granted to the clan and daimyo such as kagemasa uesugi and terumoto mori .
** in modern days , jusanmi corresponds to shishaku ( viscount ) in shakui ( the rank of nobility ) , and ranks granted to bukekazoku ( samurai families from the edo period becoming nobles in the meiji period ) who had many shishaku were notable .
in the ranks for military personnel , it corresponded to army general .
today , it is commonly granted posthumously to persons who made similar achievements as former diet members , prefectural governors , or scholars who received conferment of the kunnito ( order of second class ) .
** jushii
** " jushii " ( junior fourth rank ) is a rank in court ranks and shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) in japan .
** it ranks below shoshii ( senior fourth rank ) and above shogoi ( senior fifth rank ) .
in case of posthumous honor , it is called zojushii ( posthumous jushii ) .
** jushii
shoshii was divided into upper and lower under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) , and it ranked below jusanmi ( junior third rank ) and above jushii ( junior fourth rank ) .
under the ritsuryo system , it was divided into jushiinojo ( junior fourth rank , upper grade ) and jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) .
** for example , ' hosokawa ukyo no daibu jushiinoge minamoto no katsumoto ason . '
** under the ritsuryo system where sanmi or higher was considered kugyo , many of the collateral family members of the fujiwara clan and non-fujiwara clan middle class nobles held the court rank , shii .
** furthermore , from the muromachi period onward , it was granted to dominant shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) .
** in the meiji period , jushii corresponded to the first court rank granted to a baron in the title for nobility , and in the army and navy , it corresponded to lieutenant general .
** currently , the court rank is issued to the deceased who made achievements , and is granted to government workers who made achievements , university professors with achievements in performing arts , cultural activities , academic research , etc .
** juichii
** " juichii ( junior first rank ) " is a rank in court ranks and shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) in japan .
it ranks below shoichii ( senior first rank ) and above shonii ( senior second rank ) .
** summary
under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) , it was the highest rank granted to a queen and her female retainers .
** additionally , later when kugyo ( court noble ) who could not serve as ministers were promoted to juichii , it became a common practice that they were granted jun-daijin ( vice minister ) by imperial proclamation .
** in the edo period , when seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) retired as ogosho and then granted daijo-daijin , he were promoted to juichii .
additionally , the rank was granted to the birth mother of the shogun .
an example is keishoin , the mother of the fifth shogun , tsunayoshi tokugawa , and her title of honor was ' ichii-sama ' after being promoted to juichii .
** in the meiji period , promotions to juichii increased compared to the edo period .
juichii corresponded to the first rank granted to dukes , and those with a title of duke or lower could be promoted to juichii depending on their age .
** there are no cases of shoichii granted after world war ii , thus , today it is virtually the highest rank as a court rank of honor .
the investiture is performed by the emperor .
in kunto ( order of merit ) , it corresponds to daikuni ( highest possible order of merit ) .
for example , prime ministers who made distinguished achievements are granted juichii posthumously .
** shoichii
** " shoichii ( senior first rank ) " is one of court ranks and ranks granted to shinto gods in japan .
the highest rank among shoo ( prince or imperial grandchild without an imperial proclamation , who does not descend to the status of a subject ) and subjects , ranking above juichii .
** summary
however , only a few in history were granted the rank in life , and most cases were conferred posthumously .
additionally , this rank was not granted after world war ii , including posthumous ranks as well .
even today , although it is defined by the code for court ranks , the highest rank in fact granted is juichii ( junior first rank ) , which is one rank lower .
** in principle , shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) were never reduced , and unlike humans whose lives come to an end , gods have unlimited life-spans , which led to many shrines becoming shoichii with time .
originally , shinkai were granted to shrines and were not inherited by a shrine which the enshrined deity was moved to , but with the fall of the ritsuryo system , these shrines also carried the shinkai of their original shrines .
** dainagon ( chief councilor of state )

corresponds to shosanmi ( senior third rank ) .
in the edo period , the tokugawa shogun family , owari tokugawa family , kishu tokugawa family , and sunpu tokugawa family ( discontinued ) of the tokugawa clan were assigned .
** the main function was to assist the tasks of the minister and to attend and execute court councils , and the number of regular personnel was originally four , but reduced to two in 000 when chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) was reintroduced .
however , during the heian period , gon dainagon ( temporary dainagon with three regular personnel , which was later increased ) was established , and the number of regular personnel practically increased .
under the dokyo administration , hoshin that were similar in rank as dainagon , were established , and monks were assigned .
** chunagon
** major chunagon
** its corresponding chinese names are komon , komon jiro , monka jiro , shiko , etc .
the kani soto ( corresponding relationship between court ranks of government officials and government posts ) changed from shoshiinojo ( senior fourth rank , upper grade ) to jusanmi ( junior third rank ) .
since many heads of the mito clan were assigned as gonchunagon ( provisional vice-council of state ) , it was referred to as ' mito komon . '
the most famous is mitsukuni tokugawa , the second head of the clan , and ' mito komon ' generally refers to mitsukuni .
** however , mitsukuni was sangi ( royal advisor ) when he was the head of the clan , and became gonchunagon after retirement .
** at the time , the kani soto was shoshiinojo .
the number of regular personnel was originally three .
on february 0 , 000 ( old calendar ) , the kani soto was revised to jusanmi , since the salary was low despite heavy responsibilities .
later , the number of personnel assigned varied with time , and reached ten when highest , but was fixed at eight during the reign of emperor gotoba .
** according to the " kanshoku konan " ( " 官職今案 " ) by tomokiyo takada , during the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) , as with dainagon , there were only temporary personnel and official personnel were nonexistent .
** additionally , it was customary for the sons of sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) to be assigned as chunagon from chujo ( middle captain ) without experiencing sangi .
** choteki
** " choteki " refers to those who inflict vengeance on the emperor ( imperial line ) in japan .
** similar to ' traitor , ' it is a word chanted by those supported by , or who won over the emperor or imperial court in the era , to conspire political elimination of the political ( or at times , military ) adversary .
in many cases , they were targeted for murder by the side chanting the word .
when the side claiming to be the government army was dominant , no matter for what reason , those who were called this name was considered ' evil ' in japanese politics , at the time .
** imperial princes sometimes called one another choteki when they were in conflict , and it was considered a claim for legitimacy or declaration of war .
** sento gosho
** ok
** " sento gosho " is the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor ( retired or cloistered emperor ) .
sento originally refers to the residence of mountain hermits and is also read as ' sendo . '
this , in turn , came to mean the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor ( retired emperor or cloistered emperor ) , it was then also used as a synonym for a retired or cloistered emperor .
** mountain hermit is an idealized human figure , believed in china since ancient times , and because he lives secluded deep in the mountains , away from this world , it was used as a word praising the residence of abdicated emperors .
since the residence of noblemen are called ' gosho , ' it was called ' sento gosho . '
retired and cloistered emperors typically retired from the dairi ( imperial palace ) and moved to the sento gosho after abdicating , and the satodairi ( a temporary palace ) was often used for this purpose .
sento gosho was also called ' in , ' and this was also used as a synonym for retired and cloistered emperors .
** today , in the kyoto imperial garden in kyoto city , sento gosho is located southeast of the kyoto imperial palace ,
this was built in 0000 for emperor gomizunoo , and its official name is sakuramachiden .
a garden landscaped by enshu kobori stretches .
the buildings of the sento gosho were not rebuilt after the fire in 0000 , and only the garden remains today .
the omiya gosho lying northeast of the sento gosho was originally built as the nyoin gosho ( imperial palace of close female relatives of the emperor or a woman of comparable standing ) for tofukumonin , who was the chugu ( wife of an emperor ) of emperor gomizunoo .
** kugyo
** they began being called kugyo during the heian period .
** " kugyo bunin , " a list the personnel assigned to these posts , was created annually , and was used until daijokan was abolished during the meiji period .
the ritsuryo system was put into place after the sankokyukei ( administrative posts in the qin and han eras in china ) in the chinese rules governing administrative organizations , and the high officials were called kugyo .
courtiers at the imperial court were called kugyo hyakkan ( 000 kugyo positions ) as a whole .
** for those who were at the fourth rank and had not reached sangi , ason was added after their full names .
kugyo was also referred to as hoshino kurai ( position of the stars ) , kandachime , unjobito ( people above the clouds ) .
third rank or higher was called ki and fifth rank or higher was called tsuki .
** in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , some local daimyo ( japanese territorial lords ) in the sengoku period and their vassals announced themselves using these family names to be granted court ranks authorized by the imperial court .
the court ranks of these samurai families were called bukekani .
** nobunaga oda was originally from the inbe clan , but is said to have changed his family name to taira due to the genpeikotairon ( minamoto and taira clans rotation theory ) .
** later , he was granted the toyotomi family name , which is the fifth family name , by emperor ogimachi .
** ieyasu tokugawa was originally from the kamo clan , but he first referred to himself as fujiwara , and then requested the nitta clan rewrite the family tree and changed his family name to minamoto .
** kokujin
** " kokujin " are the samurai class , mainly originating from the jito ( manager and lord of manor ) class in the kamakura period , who engaged in the development of provinces from the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) to the muromachi period .
kokujin ryoshu ( local samurai lord ) .
kunishu or kokujinshu , when referring to them collectively .
** it was used to refer to the residing forces who were in rivalry with outside rulers such as the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , shugo ( provincial constable ) , and manor lords , and who aimed for their own regional dominance .
** the name ' kokujin ' is found here and there , since the kamakura period , as a word referring to ' samurai with their own power centered around a chief residing in the area . '
their direct origin are the samurai who were jito during the kamakura period , who indigenized and became resident feudal lords .
during the kamakura period , they were sometimes referred to as ' akuto ' ( rebels ) , implying they are rebellious against the rulers .
** it was around the time from the fall of the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) , and especially after the kanno disturbance , that this class of samurai became significant .
during the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) , provincial politics and military affairs were led by feudal lords based in the province .
however , kokujin responded acutely to movements in the central political arena .
kokujin rose to become a residing force with power reserved to influence the actions of the muromachi bakufu , shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) , and manor lords .
** the kokujin class intervened in conflicts between the manor lord and the jigenin ( a lower rank of ancient japanese nobility ) , and at times , undertook posts such as daikan ( local government representative ) and shomu ( land management ) .
regional governance by kokujin ryoshu was stronger against land and farmers compared to governance by the resident feudal lords before them .
such examples are kenchi ( land survey ) and hitogaeshi ( people who had moved to other land and then returned to their original land according to agreements between feudal lords ) agreements between kokujin .
** kokujin-ikki ( riots by kokujin ) that occurred frequently from the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) to the muromachi period , varied in style , but can be seen as uniting kokujin ryoshu .
** in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) , in regions where the reign of the shugo daimyo withered , kokujin existed as independent feudal lords owning castles .
like the kiso and murakami clans , most kokujin were incorporated into the vassalry of the daimyo ( japanese territorial lord ) during the sengoku period .
meanwhile , some kokujin with daimyo-class power , such as the mori clan , chosokabe clan , ryuzoji clan , and tamura clan , became daimyo during the sengoku period .

** sangi
** ritsuryo system
** meiji government
** " sangi " is one of the posts in the daijokan ( grand council of state ) , which is the highest organ in the imperial court organization for ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) in japan .
it is a post ranking below chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) , and corresponds to suke ( assistant director ) in the shitokan ( four classifications of bureaucrats ' ranks ) .
its chinese names are saisho and shoko .
it means to participate in imperial court politics , and serves as the giseikan ( top officials in the daijokan ) in imperial court politics .
** there are no imperial edicts or letters laying out the kani soto ( corresponding relationship between court ranks of government officials and government posts ) of sangi , so there is no corresponding rank .
thus , neither gyo nor shu is added depending on the rank .
( for example , it is written sangi shonii ( senior second rank ) or sangi jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) . )
** however , there is no trace of imperial edicts or letters being announced to lay out the number of regular personnel for sangi , and the number varied with time .
under the dokyo administration , hosangi ( monk sangi ) which was similar in rank as sangi was established , and monks were assigned .
** a post in the meiji government established by ' oseifukko ' ( restoration of imperial rule ) .
it was established as an important post in the meiji government with the return of the daijokan system in july 0000 , and personnel were assigned from satsuma , choshu , tosa , and hizen clans .
seiin ( highest organ in the daijokan organization system ) was organized after the haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) , and after the political upheaval of the 0th year of meiji , they concurrently served as the secretary of ministries .
it was abolished in 0000 , when the cabinet system was established .
** akuto
** emergence
** background of the change
** development
** research history
** this section describes the details of akuto in japanese history .
** however , the term akuto is detected frequently from then on .
** as seen in this example , those who attempted to invade or disturb the system maintained by manor lords and shokan ( an officer governing shoen ( manor ) ) from outside the manors and imperial demesne , were considered akuto .
** honjo suffered from akuto activities since the 00th century , but akuto circumvented pursuit by honjo by escaping to other territories , etc .
honjo frequently requested the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to pursuit the akuto , but the bakufu was passive about it , pointing out that conflicts among honjo were originally under the jurisdiction of the imperial court .
** meanwhile , a major shift in medieval society began around the middle of the 00th century .
consequently , samurai forces that repeatedly self-propagated through succession and property division to soryo ( heir ) and shoshi ( child born out of wedlock ) , lost the opportunity to obtain territory and shifted to single succession , where territory was inherited by the soryo only .
** with the single succession as a momentum , soryo consolidated their territories scattered in various quarters and engaged in the management of their residing territory .
in the process , the fall of the samurai class centering around shoshi occurred , while territorial conflict between honjo ( proprietor or guarantor of manor ) and the residing samurai became radical .
** the various contradictions within the samurai class or manor governance led to the mobility of medieval society , and resulted in the increase in akuto activities from the late thirteenth century onward .
additionally , genko ( mongol invasion attempts against japan ) , which occurred around this time also intensified the various contradictions , and induced the increase of akuto activities .
** in addition to akuto who invaded manor governance from the outside , ezo ( northerners ) and kaimin ( people who lived and worked on the seas ) who committed piracy were also called akuto , which based on the concept of seeing outsiders of the system as akuto .
for this same reason , it is believed that entertainers and wandering monks who traveled in various provinces were considered to have akuto-like characteristics .
yoshihiko amino described these ' akuto ' as bearers of the distribution and capital economy , which developed rapidly from the mid-00th century , and as one of the main constituents opening the way for a new phase in medieval society .
** change in the situation where only outside intruders of the system were called akuto occurred during the koan years ( 0000 - 0000 ) .
these affairs indicated that insiders were also treated as ' akuto , ' and this was a sign of a major change in the concept .
** at this stage , the shokan class in conflict with honjo is believed to have included the drifting akuto described above .
some of them were involved in trade while traveling in various places , accumulated capital as a bearer of distribution economy , and were called utokujin ( the rich ) .
in some cases , such utokujin were assigned as shokan due to their economic power , and became engaged in territory management .
** since the late 00th century , akuto were active in the kinai ( the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of nara and kyoto ) , tohoku , and kyushu areas , and there were cases of akuto and jito unions prohibited in the goseibai-shikimoku .
the activities of akuto led to mobilization of the system , and to respond to this , the bakufu began actively suppressing the akuto from the end of the 00th century .
** originally , honjo held jurisdiction over law enforcement and judicial power at the honjo-ichienchi , and the imperial court would rule .
however , due to the extreme infestation of akuto , honjo strongly requested the bakufu to suppress them .
thus , in the early 0000s , the following suppression procedure was established .
first , the honjo files a complaint to the imperial court , and if the accused ( akuto ) does not answer the summons , it is considered a disobedience against the emperor , and the imperial court orders the bakufu to commence prosecution and conviction .
the order received by the bakufu is called ichoku rinji or ichoku inzen .
upon receiving the rinji ( the emperor ' s command ) or inzen ( cloistered emperor ' s declaration ) , the bakufu appointed two gokenin as envoys ( ryoshi ) .
ryoshi were allowed to enter the honjo-ichienchi , which were off-limits to shugo ( provincial constable ) , in order to execute their duties , and in some cases , were authorized to order shitaji jungyo ( implementation of decisions regarding land ) to the honjo side .
this procedure which began as a way to pursue akuto , became the root for the right of shisetsu jungyo ( process for implementing bakufu ' s decision on conflicts regarding property ownership ) during the muromachi period .
** a prominent akuto from this period was the oe clan , ' kuroda akuto , ' who was successful in the kuroda no sho ( iga province ) , a territory of todai-ji temple , from the 00th to 00th century .
** jingikan
** summary
** jin ' of jingikan indicates amatsukami ( god of heaven ) , ' gi ' of that does kunitsukami ( god of earth ) and the organization handled religious services as shown in its name .
being placed above daijokan ( grand council of state ) that handled administration , it was placed at the top of the government system .
** however , their ranks were low : for example , is is said that the rank of after-mentioned jingi haku ( a chief official in charge of matters relating to shintoism ) was jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) .
in other words , jingikan is placed above daijokan in shikinryo ( the law which stipulated duties of the ministries ) , but is placed below daijokan in documental administration .
** before the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code )
** under the ritsuryo system
since the person assuming the post of jingi haku was called o ( prince ) though working under an emperor , the family was also called the shirakawa-haku-o family .
** after the ritsuryo system was abolished
** in the meiji period
restoration of jingikan
on february 00 , 0000 , the jingi jimuka ( clerical department ) was established together with six other clerical departments .
it was placed at the head of the seven departments .
on february 00 , 0000 , the seven clerical departments were reorganized into clerical bureas under the general bureau , and the jingi jimuka became the jingi clerical bureau .
** jingikan in the meiji period
on june 00 , 0000 , a seitai-sho ( a document for the government system ) imitating the government system based on the ancient ritsuryo system was issued , and dajokan ( great council of state ) system was established .
jingikan was also restored offcially and was placed under dajokan .
in june of 0000 , jingikan became independent of daiokan , and was placed at the head of the administrative system .
** in addition to religious services , celebrations and jinfuko ( managing households burdening religion-related matters ) , the roles of jingikan in the meiji period included shoryo ( the administration of imperial tombs ) and religious mission .
however , to accommodate another new role given to jingikan , the govermental office called " senkyoshi ( missionary ) " was placed under it .
the primary objectives of religious mission were to prevent the infiltration of chiristian religion and to proclaim to the japanese people the national policies after the meiji restoration , and this new role , requested by the national government , was given to jingikan .
** it was planned to do a religious service for the temporary shrine by emperor meiji , but the plan failed to be realized because the timing was not good ( the emperor had a cold then ) .
on january 0 , 0000 , a religious service was conducted , and emperor meiji sent sanetomi sanjo to the service .
in this temporary shrine , the spirits of all the emperors in the past , that of the gods of heaven and earth were also enshrined in addition to the eight gods worshipped by jingikan in the ritsuryo system .
** ministry of jingi
in july of 0000 , jingikan was down-graded to the ministry of jingi and was placed under dajokan .
seemingly appearing to have lowered the position of the jingi administration , this measure was in fact taken aiming at a closer unity of religion and state .
due to this reason sanetomi sanjo , grand minister of state , assumed the post of jingi-haku when jingikan was going to be downgraded to ministry of jingi .
in the ministry of jingi , religious services in shrines by senior , middle and junior officer in charge of the religious services and religion-promoting activities by missionaries were clearly separated .
on october 00 , 0000 , the emperor instructed to place jingi in a safe place and the spirists of the past emperors were moved from hasshinden to the palace .
** abolishment of the ministry of jingi and establishement of kyobusho ( ministry of religion )
on april 00 , 0000 , the ministry of jingi was abolished .
to achive this , the ministry of jingi was abolished and it was decided that shikiburyo ( department of rites ) , which existed during the early meiji period ( 0000 to 0000 ) , of the imperial household ministry should conduct religious services .
** movements after the establishment of kyobusho
however , corresponding to improvement of the school-based education system , the role of kyobusho dimished , and kyobusho was abolished on january 00 , 0000 , with some of its roles inherited by the bureau of shrines and temples in the interior ministry .
however , since the movement for restoring jingikan gained force , the bureau of shinto shrines was established in 0000 separated from the bureau of shrines and temples .
in 0000 , jingi-in was established replaceing bureau of shinto shrines for events commemorating the 0 , 000-th anniversary of the start of the emperor system .
however , the war ended before jingi-in produced any marked results administratively .
jingi-in was abolished on february 0 , 0000 , and the right of controlling shrines in japan was inherited by jinja honcho ( association of shinto shrines ) established on the next day .
** kitano mandokoro
** kitano mandokoro is the title given , through an emperor ' s proclamation , to the legally wedded wife of the person in the position of sessho ( regent ) or kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) .
** summary
originally , mandokoro indicated a household-handling organization ( an office handling private affairs concerning the family and residence ) whose establishment was permitted only for imperial princes and kugyo ( top court officials ) who held the rank of sanmi ( the third rank ) or higher .
** the reason why the position of a legally wedded wife was so strong is that a nobleman married his bride to enter her family , and therefore , his residence was originaly owned by her family .
when the master of the residence advanced to a position of sanmi and opened mandokoro , the ' kitanokata ' was called ' kitano kandokoro . '
** later , it was formalized so that the tile of ' kitano mandokoro ' was given by the emperor ' s proclamation , and the title came to be given only to the legally wedded wife of sessho or kanpaku .
** examples in the taira family
however , the legally wedded wives of sessho or kanpaku were called ' kitano mandokoro ' for generations , and it also happened that a number of kitano mandokoro existed at the same time .
** for example , in a portion of vol . 0 of " the tale of the heike " , the daughters of taira no kiyomori were introduced as follows :
** ……one of his daughters became the kitano mandokoro of sesshodono at rokujo . ……his other daughter became the kitano mandokoro of fugenjidono .
one more daughter of his became the kitano-kata of reizei dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) takafusa .
** ho-taiko and kitano mandokoro
** as the title of ' kitano mandokoro ' was given to the legally wedded wife of sesshu or kanpaku , that of ' okitanomandokoro ' or ' omandokoro ' in short was given to the mother who gave birth to sessho or kanpaku .
this term had been a generic one as well , but after the title was given to the mother ( naka ) who gave birth to hideyoshi , the term came to be used for indicating her alone .
** rronin ( masterless samurai )
** in the tokugawa/edo period
** 浪人 ( ronin ) indicated a person who wandered about provinces other than the one that was recorded in his family register , and was also called a furo ( vagabond )
anyone could be a roin regardles of his social status .
the term of 流浪人 ( ruronin : meaing a wanderer ) originates here .
in and after the middle of the edo period , 牢人 ( who was separated from his master and lost his salary ) also came to be called 浪人 ( ronin ) .
therefore , correctly , 牢人 and 浪人 each had a different meaning .
** for it , 牢人 indicates a person who left ( or lost ) his master and lost his salary .
in the strict sense , it was a term only related to the social status of a samurai who had a master-servant relationship from the muromachi to the edo period .
when the edo period started after the war period ended , the number of 牢人 who wandered around various provinces increased due to kaieki ( punishment whereby a samurai was deprived of his samurai status and his fief and residence were confiscated ) .
therefore , the 牢人 who wandered around came to be called 浪人 .
** in this item , descriptions are made for 牢人 ( samurai ) .
** in the kamakura and muromachi periods
in the kamakura and muromachi periods when a samurai owned his fief , the term indicated a person who lost his fief and position and became a wanderer .
in these periods , small-scale wars frequently occurred in various places , and so , even if a samrai became 浪人 , there were lots of opportunities to find a new master because daimyo ( japanese territorial lords ) needed warriors .
because the public security was poor , 浪人 banded together in various places and some of them stole things or caused riots .
in this period , the meaning of 浪人 was close to a person who wandered around , although 牢人 existed , and it was in the late muromachi period that the social status-indicating the term of 牢人 came to be firmly used .
** in the sengoku period ( period of warring states )
in this period , there were many samurai who became 牢人 and changed daimyo families under which they were employed , and there were even 牢人 who eventually became a daimyo himself .
takatora todo worked under ten master families in his life .
in addition , in this period , the social status was not yet strictly specialized , and it was easy for a samrai to become a merchant or a farmer , and vice versa .
** in the toyotomi/osaka period
when hideyoshi toyotomi unified the control of the nation and the war period ended , the situations around 牢人 changed .
it became unnecessary for each daimyo family to retain many vassals .
when ieyasu tokugawa of the eastern military group won the battle of sekigahara , many daimyo families of the western military group lost their positions as well as their territories or were forced to reduce their territories , producing lots of 牢人 .
** the siege of osaka
entering the edo period , daimyo families recruited few samurai because they had already retained too many vassals .
mototsugu goto , who left the kuroda family had the door closed for serving another daimyo due to the ' hokokamae ' issued and ended up participating on the side of toyotomi in the siege of osaka .
** the number of 牢人 who could not get a post in a daimyo family increased drastically , and 000 , 000 牢人 flocked to the side of toyotomi when the siege of osaka arose .
** although many 牢人 were killed in the siege of osaka , the number of 牢人 increased because the bukufu continued abolishing daimyo and it is said that the number reached 000 , 000 towards the end of iemitsu tokugawa ' s life .
initially , the bakufu governent considered 牢人 to be dangerous and undertook the strict policy of expelling them from urban areas , of restricting the areas where they lived and of prohibiting them from serving a new lord .
牢人 were more and more hard-pressed and the situation led shosetsu yui and others to plan the overthrow of the bakufu ( the keian incident ) .
the 牢人 who wandered around or could not get vassal positions came to be called 浪人 ( ronin ) .
** however , even thereafter , there were many samurai who were fired from the master ' s families due to various reasons and became 牢人 .
** situations of 浪人
牢人 in the edo period lost shiseki ( samurai status ) , but was acknowledged as samurai , with use of his family name and wearing swords being permitted .
their everyday lives were placed under the control of town magistrate , as were those of the merchants and craftsmen .
some did fine craft work to earn a living , some others became successful merchants , but there were some who became desparate and committed crimes , like robbery
musashi miyamoto is a 牢人 famous for his swordmanship .
** towards the end of the edo period
towards the end of the edo period , 浪人 actively participated in political activities .
as ryoma sakamoto , a goshi ( generally meaning a low-status samurai living in a village ) , was , there were many 浪人 who severed their ties with domains full of restrictions and acted freely .
on the other hand , there appeared the persons who , though not being from samurai status families , such as merchants , craftsmen and farmers , got family names and wore swords by themselves , claiming to be 浪人 .
many members of shinsengumi ( a group who guarded kyoto during the end of tokugawa shogunate ) , which are said to have been a group of 浪人 , came from , merchants , craftsmen or farmers .
** after meiji restoration , the equality of all people was proclaimed and the status of 浪人 vanished as well .
** from the middle of the meiji period to the early taisho period
these shizoku class persons were also called 浪人 .
when empress myeongseong was assasinated in the itsubi incident on october 0 , 0000 , after sino-japanese war , many 浪人 were included in the assasination team led by japanese troops .
such a team was called a training team .
** hokoshu
** summary
** history
** hokoshu was a govermental position established by the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
it is military power belonging directly to the shogun , and was called ban-shu or ban-kata because it was organized as goke-ban ( literally , five ban ) .
it was also called banshu ( kobanshu ) .
** if bugyoshu ( group of magistrates ) were civilian officials during the muromachi bakufu government ,
** hokoshu could be called military officials .
** it is said that hokoshu was also organized under kamakura kubo ( shogunal representative ) and under furukawa kubo .
** its members consisted of dominent gokenin , members of the ashikaga clan , powerful shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) and kokujin ( local samurai ) .
with the membeship of a squad inherited , it is said that the bond among the members was strong , and they acted jointly in the onin war .
the number of hokoshu of the mikawa province , located at an important location for the ashikaga clan , was more than 00 , the largest of all of the provinces .
** during peacetime , hokoshu commuted , for example , to bannai ( the squad room ) placed within the palace , and functioned as military power in emergencioes .
hokoshu was entrusted to the management of local goryosho ( shogunate ' s estate ) and was also given the rights to prevent shugo ( provincial constable ) from entering their own lands and to collect tansen ( a kind of provisional tax in medieval japan ) .
** therefore , yoshimitsu ashikaga , the third shogun , formed a goup of bodyguards called oumamawari to confront shugo ' s power .
they played an active role as military power belonged directly to the shogun in meitoku war , caused by the yamana clan , and in the oei war , caused by the ouchi clan in 0000 .
** however , yoshimochi ashikaga , the fouth shogun , still depended on the military power of the hatakeyama clan , and yoshinori ashikaga , the sixth shogun , aimed at strengthening his power following the policies used by yoshimitsu ashikaga .
** samuraidokoro
** samuraidokoro was the organization that played military and police roles in the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and in the muromachi bakufu .
** in the kamakura bakufu
it called up and commanded the gokenin who were to do event-guarding or some other jobs , and locked up criminals .
** dominant gokenin who assumed the post of shoshi ( deputy chief of the board of retainers ) or samurai-dokoro no tsukasa ( the officer of the board of retainers ) controlled samuraidokoro , and the person in the highest rank among shoshi was called betto ( chief officer ) .
initially , yoshimori wada assumed the post of betto , but after yoshimori died in the wada battle , shikken ( regent to the shogun ) assumed the post as well .
** in the muromachi bakufu
following the organization of the kamakura bakufu , it was established in 0000 together with mandokoro ( administrative board ) and monchujo ( a court of justice ) .
** in the era of the second shogun yoshiakira , the job of kebiishicho ( the office dealing with police and judicial matters ) was transferred to samuraidokoro , and samuraidokoro became to gain police power for maintaining security of kyoto as well as the power to levy taxes
in the era of the third shogun yoshimitsu , shugo ( provincial constable ) was placed in the yamashiro province , and samuraidokoro became an organization to control kyoto as the area directly controlled by muromachi-dono ( muromachi bakufu ) .
** the person in the post called shoshi or tonin ( the director ) controlled samuraidokoro , and shoshi-dai assisted shoshi .
actual operations were conducted by bugyonin ( magistrate ) , and kodoneri and zoshiki , lower-ranked officers , were also organized .
in addition , kaiko ( the head of clerical officers ) was placed for clerical officers , and there were also metsuke who played watching roles and yoriudo who were equivalent to interrogators .
** chronological table
** in addition , descriptions of a banquet that was held and baggage that was stored , were included in azumakagami ( the mirror of the east ) , a historical book in japan .
** koto no naishi
** personalities
in 0000 , yoshisada nitta defeated takauji ashikaga , who was alienated from the new government , in kyoto together with masashige kusunoki and akiie kitabatake , and takauji ashikaga and his followers fled to kyushu .
** it was also described that her father , yoshifusa , followed yoshisada nitta and also died in battle in hokuriku .
a legend also describes that koto no naishi entered the sea at the kotogahama beach and died .
** in imakatata , there exists nogami-jinja shrine whose god is koto no naishi and there is a temple for her , senpuku-ji temple , and the nogami festival was also held for consoling her spirit .
in addition , after contents of " taiheiki " became well-known through performances of storytellers in the edo period , graves of koto no naishi were built in various places .
** it is also pointed out that some of koto no naishi-tsubone " s ( -tubone : a honorary suffix attachde to the name of a high-ranked female in the court ) income came from mikuniminato near to fujishima where yoshisada nitta died in a battle .
** her grave is located in ojima-machi , ota city , gunma prefecture ( former ojima town , nitta county )
** toshi choja
** toshi choja indicates ujichoja ( the head ) of the fujiwara clan .
** summary
choja ' of a clan indicates in the ancient and medieval times , the representative of the clan , who controlled them .
as the representative of the fujiwara clan , the toshi choja handled all matters concerned with the clan , including its politics , finance and religion .
** its origin
** other activities
in addition , to maintain the position of his clan in the imperial court , toshi choja sometimes had the obligation to present opinions of his clan members to the imperial court .
it is well known that fujiwara no yorimichi and fujiwara no norimichi confronted the imperial familiy , and this clearly shows that they , as the representative of the clan , confronted the imperial family trying to suppress the power of the fujiwara clan .
this was a cause of the hogen war ( the war in the hogen era ) .
** shuki/daiban
as the emperor inherits three sacred imperial treasures and crown prince does tsubokiri no mitsurugi ( the sword tsubokiri ) from one generation to the next , there is the treasure of the clan that each toshi choja inherits from generation to generation .
** choja no kan no watarishoken : the certificate for the territory called denka no watari-ryo .
shuki : vermillion-lacqured tableware
daiban : dishes
kenko : a leathe scale
** in addition , the maintenance and management of kangakuin ( dormitory for students ) was under the control of toshi choja .
** in the later eras
generally , clans in ancient times dispersed gradually corresponding to the establishements of family lines during the heian period ( however , it does not mean that the clans were dismantled ) .
the roles of toshi choja became increasingly more religious , and were also deconcentrated to kofuku-ji temple , kasuga-sha shrine and so on .
** the roles of toshi choja ended at meiji restoration , with michitaka kujo as the last .
** shogun family
** in addition to the shogun himself , it included the heir and other family members , after a hereditary system was established , and mandokoro , its household organization .
** this concept was first introduced when minamoto no yoritomo was designated as ukone no daisho ( major captain of the right division of inner palace guards ) , and he applied this concept to his own master-servant relationships .
this term was used for yoritomo and his vassals , gokenin to establish control of the nation by themselves independent of the imperial court .
later , yoritomo himself was designated for seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) , followed by his sons , minamoto no yoriie and minamoto no sanetomo , establishing the system of making the post of seii taishogun hereditary .
then the term ' shogun family , ' an abbreviation of the ' seii taishogun family ' and of the former ' udaisho ' ( the head of the right division ) family , both yoritomo ' s position names , was established .
** since minamoto no sanetomo in the post of seii taishogun also assumed the post of udaijin ( minister of the right ) , it became possible for the person in the post of seii taishogun to assume a daijin ( minister ) post .
however , during the kamakura period , the shogun from sekkan-ke ( the families which produced regents ) and shogun from the imperial court did not take the post of ministry even after he was released from the shogun post .
it was yoshimitsu ashikaga during the muromachi period , who took the post of naidaijin ( inner minister ) , when shogun assumed the post of a ministry again .
** during the muromachi period , the term kubo instead of shogunke ( shogun family ) was used for seii taishogun .
in the edo period , the term was used for tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of tokugawa family ) , for gosankyo ( three privileged branches of tokugawa family ) , and for the heir of shogun against a child from a legally unwedded wife of shogun .
** the shogun family played the role of the clan governing japan throughout the samurai-based government era .
although designated by the emperor , it boasted the power exceeding that of the imperial family in the era when the samurai-based government was first established .
although the shogun family was formally placed under the imperial court , it was customary that the shogun family was accepted as a royal family by foreign countries .
** obanyaku
** obanyaku was the post assigned to samurai from non-capital areas to maintain the security of kyoto during the later heian to early muromachi period or to maintain the security of kamakura city during the kamakura period .
** during the kamakura and later periods , the post was assigned to each province , and shogo in each province was responsible for selecting the gokenin to assume the post in the province ( oban saisoku ) .
in the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) , it became almost extinct .
** kyoto obanyaku
the post to guard the palace and the residences of special imperial family members ( and later those of the fujiwara clan ) in kyoto was called kyoto obanyaku .
** however , towards the end of the heian period , it gave a chance fo samurai from non-capital provinces to gain a connection with kuge in the capital , and some samurai could obtain an official rank through their connections .
also , some at the post learned culture in the capital , such as making waka poems and brought it back to their original provinces
** in addition , it also happened that , while a father , the head of a clan , was in kyoto and his son in his original province , the father could not speedily handle disturbances that occurred in the province ( an example : shigetada hatakeyama ) .
** kamakura obanyaku
the post for guarding the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) in kamakura was called kamakura obanyaku .
it is concerned with the service of favors and services .
in the feaudal system based on favors and services , it became a natural post for the gokenin who served the bakufu .
** kanto moshitsugi
** then , after daikakuji-to emperor godaigo defeated the kamakura bakufu , the saionji family was badly criticized , and dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) , kinmune saionji , who was the last kanto moshitsugi , was executed on suspicion of a rebellion .
** inshi/in no tsukasa
** inshi in the cloister government
** main posts
** generally mid-ranking aristocrats were appointed to inshi concurrently with other japanese official posts .
as the cloister government started in the late heian period , the post of inshi in in no cho , a retired emperor ' s political organ , became an important post .
** this section describes the details of the inshi of the cloister government .
** the first case of inshi was confirmed as in no betto ( chief administrator of the retired emperor ' s office ) abe no yasuhito in 000 , during the reign of emperor saga .
at first , in no cho was established as a household agency for retired emperors and its main work consisted of trials dealing with land-related issues and with civil affairs .
the ranks of inshi were betto ( chief officer ) , hogandai ( deputy chief officer ) and sakandai ( secretary ) .
** when emperor shirakawa started the cloister government around 0000 , the role of inshi , which made up in no cho , became very important .
therefore , practical government officials who held successively the position of kurododokoro ( the chamberlain ' s office ) , benkan ( officials of the dajokan ) and zuryo ( the head of the provincial governors ) often became inshi .
although they were not high-ranking aristocrats like sekkan-ke ( the families which produced regents ) people , they had political influence because of their business ability .
** some inshi and other mid-ranking aristocrats became close advisors of the emperor and cloistered emperor with real power and wielded influence .
they were called in no kinshin ( the retired emperor ' s courtier ) .
inshi and in no kinshin made various profits behind imperial power and they often received chigyo-koku ( provincial fiefdom ) .
one of the main reasons that taira no kiyomori gained power quickly after the hogen war , was that he was an inshi of emperor goshirakawa .
** in no betto : the highest officer of inshi
the first in no betto was minamibuchi no nagakawa , who was appointed as the in no betto at the same time the retired emperor saga abdicated the throne .
generally , several persons were appointed as in no betto , and mostly kugyo ( the top court officials ) or kurodo no to ( head chamberlain ) who served the retired emperor during the reign as the emperor were appointed as in no betto .
when kugyo was appointed as betto , it was called " kugyo betto " , and when shii ( fourth rank ) was appointed , it was called " shii betto . "
also , in the kamakura period , the post of in no shikken was added above in no shitsushi and in no nenyo and selected from kugyo bettos .
** in hogandai : the second highest officer in inshi and assisted betto , conducted general affairs and signed official letters issued by in no cho .
this position was set during the reign of emperor uda .
during the reign of the retired emperor shirakawa , there were hogandai with shii ( fourth rank ) , however , usually one or two hogandai were selected from goi ( fifth rank ) and four or five hogandai were selected from rokui ( sixth rank ) .
** inshutendai ( secretary of the in no tsukasa , the third rank officer ) : their main works were such as document and record creation and management in in no cho and civil affairs under the betto and the hogandai .
this position was set during the reign of emperor suzaku .
two or three shutendai were selected from rokui ( sixth rank ) .
in the reign of emperor goshirakawa , one " cho no nenyo " which was the highest officer in in no cho ( different post from in no nenyo ) was selected .
** inkurodo ( palace officer ) : this post was for the kurodo with the sixth rank who could not reach the post of inshutendai even though they had served the retired emperor since his reign as emperor .
according to " shugaisho " ( an ancient encyclopedia in 00c ) the fixed number of places was four .
** indenso ( introducing officer ) : they were in charge of relaying various messages to the retired emperor .
as the first indenso , tsunefusa yoshida and takashina no yasutsune during the reign of the retired emperor goshirakawa were confirmed .
this post functioned in reality after emperor gosaga appointed tametsune yoshida and sadatsugu hamuro in 0000 and they were in charge of all messages except kanto moshitsugi ( adjusting works between the retired emperor and kamakura bakufu ) .
during the reign of emperor kameyama , in 0000 , six members of indenso were divided into three pairs and each pair worked in rotation .
buke tenso ( liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government ) was derived from indenso .
during the edo period , incumbent or predecessor dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) and chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) were appointed as indenso and buke tenso concurrently .
** inmizuijin ( palace guard ) : they worked as guard for the retired emperor and his palace .
mostly , they were selected from konoefu ( division of inner palace guards ) .
the fixed number of places was five each ( later six each ) from sayu konoefu ( the left and right divisions of the inner palace guards ) .
when the retired emperor entered the priesthood and became a cloistered emperor , he returned zuijins as a sign of renouncing the world .
however , each zuijin with the rank of konoe shoso ( fourth rank officer in palace guard division ) from the left and right divisions of palace guards stayed in the cloistered imperial agency as officials .
** naishi no tsukasa
** official duties
** rank
** structure
** naishi no kami/shoji
** naishi no suke/tenji
** naishi no jo/shoji
** nyoju
** naishi no tsukasa was one of the cutcherry in government-regulated organizations in japan .
it was one of the 00 offices belonging to kokyu , empress ' s residence fixed by ryo code ( administrative laws ) and consisted of only court ladies .
** court ladies in naishi no tsukasa served the emperor closely and dealt with affairs like introducing messages , transmitting imperial orders and managing imperial formal events .
this position was a kind of emperor ' s secretary and talented ladies who were well versed in academics and etiquette were appointed .
** thus , this divine mirror was called ' naishidokoro . '
** the rank of court ladies in naishi no tsukasa was not so high according to the rule of ryo .
but little by little , their official duties became important and the rank became much higher during the reign of emperor heizei in 000 .
that was one of the causes of the kusuko incident .
** after the mid heian period , structure of the 00 offices belonging to kokyu was reorganized and the naishi no tsukasa became only one practical official in kokyu .
naishi no kami/shoji , a chief of naishi no tsukasa was treated almost as an empress , and naishi no suke who was a deputy chief had the characteristics of an emperor ' s concubine .
** chief of naishi no tsukasa
the official rank of naishi no kami was jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) , then upgraded to jusanmi ( junior third rank ) .
the prescribed number was two .
mostly daughters of sekkan-ke ( the families which produced regents ) were selected .
originally , only naishi no kami could deal with the official duties such as introducing messages and transmitting imperial orders , and naishi no suke and other lower ranked court ladies could not deal with them .
** later , as naishi no kami was treated almost as an empress , naishi no suke and the lower ranked court ladies dealt with the actual duties .
between the late heian and kamakura periods , naishi no kami was not appointed .
** deputy chief
the official rank of naishi no suke was jurokui ( junior sixth rank ) , then upgraded to jushii ( junior fourth rank ) .
the prescribed number was four .
mostly daughters of court nobles such as dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) and chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) were selected .
** the third ranked officials
official rank of naishi no jo was jushichii ( junior seventh rank ) , then upgraded to jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) .
the prescribed number was six , consisting of four regular officials and two irregular officials .
normally , ' naishi ' means naishi no jo .
** naishi no jo for joro ( high rank female servant in the imperial court ) with the first rank was called ' koto no naishi ' or ' nagahashi no tsubone . '
they always served for emperors and were in charge of naishi no kami ' s roles such as introducing messages and transmitting imperial orders , and transmitted the official orders to kurodo ( chamberlain ) .
after naishi no kami and naishi no suke became a mere facade , actual roles of naishi no tsukasa were pursued centering on koto no naishi .
koto no naishi had more power than daitenji , who was a high rank woman servent in the imperial court , externally during the edo period .
** nyoju was a lower ranked court lady in naishi no tsukasa .
the prescribed number was one hundred .
they were in charge of miscellaneous duties .
** yakata
** before the establishment of the yakata-go titling system
** social status of yakata-go title
** kanto-hachi-yakata
** an anecdote about yakata-go in the " hojo genan oboegaki "
** yakata means a mansion of exalted personage such as kuge ( court nobles ) and buke ( samurai families ) .
under the reign of the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and edo bakufu , it also meant a title or a honorific title allowed to a head of any distinguished family or of samurai family who was credited with his achievements .
this is also called yakata-go ( a title given to a yakata . )
** the synonims for yakata are yakatamono ( a person who lives in a yakata , ) yakatabune ( a roofed pleasure boat ) and so on .
** before the heian period , the term ' shiro ' ( castle ) meant ' saku ' ( a barrier ) or ' toride ' ( a fort ) , but not a residence .
subsequently , along with the rise of buke ( samurai families ) , their ' shiro ' with strategical advantages became important also as their residences , and the original meaning of ' yakata ' had changed to become virtually nominal .
** in the society of buke , ' tono ' and ' tonosama ' were generally used as the mainstream honorific titles for a lord .
such daimyo were also respectfully called ' uesama . '
while a legal wife of a daimyo holding a title of yakata-go was referred to as ' urakatasama ' or ' gotaiho , ' his legitimate son was respectfully called ' shin-yakatasama ' or ' uesama ' in large part .
** for example , kaneyori shiba from an illegitimate family of the shiba clan which belonged to the ashikaga clan , received a title of yakata-go and accordingly named himself as mogami yakata so that he is regarded as the founder of the mogami clan . .
among kokujin-ryoshu , miya clan , who served as bakufu ' s hokoshu ( a military post in the muromachi shogunate , ) was appointed as shugo of bicchu province and awarded with the title of yakata-go , in 0000 .
in 0000 , yoshinori ashikaga conferred a yakata-go title to the masuda clan , who was a prominent local samurai in iwami province , for their achievements in quelling rebellions and riots in the kinai region .
also , yoshitane ashikaga allowed taneshige chiba , kokujin ryoshu of hizen province , to hold a yakata-go title , meanwhile soke ( the head family ) of chiba clan was also holding one of kanto-hachi-yakata .
judging from these facts so far , kokujin ryoshu were considered as eligible to receive yakata-go titles .
** for reference , what the word ' yakata ' indicated was merely the family of the title holder , and , therefore , it was regarded as irreverent to use the title as honorific title of the head of the other families .
any daimyo authorized to hold a yakata-go title was allowed to have his retainers wear samurai eboshi ( a lacquered hat ) , hitatare ( a kind of court dress in old days ) and suo ( formal middle rank dress , usually includeing jacket and hakama ) .
** ashikaga shogun renshi ( brothers and sisters of ashikaga shogun , ) kanrei ( shogunal deputies , ) and tandai ( local military commissioners ) were privileged to endorse licenses for yakata-go titles in order to abbreviate autographies .
** ( any one ranked as shugodai was usually authorized to bear karakasabukuro ( a bag for oiled paper umbrella ) along with mosenkuraoi and nurigoshi . )
** by mitsukane ashikaga , who was kamakura kubo , yakata-go titles were awarded to various dominant shugo in the kanto region .
** in his letter , genan taught her that she should respectfully call her father in law , yoriyasu kira , ' oyakatasama , ' and her mother in law ' otaiho , ' as well as her husband ' uesama . '

** the middle palace guard was created during the reign of emperor tenmu to attend to or guard the emperor and his family by enhancing and expanding the function of valets chosen from children of the regional administrators .
after the taiho code was established , it split into left and right divisions .
in the yoro code , the names of the internal posts were changed .
under the rule of fujiwara no nakamaro , it was renamed " kohonei " in 000 , but six years later , the former name was restored with the fall of nakamaro .
with the decline of the regional administrators and locally appointed officials in the provinces , the middle palace guard gave the reins of power to the newly established inner palace guard , and subsequently became downsized .
** hyoe no kami ( captain )
** one person was assigned to each of the left and the right divisions .

there was no substitute post for captain .
in the ritsuryo system , it was a position corresponding to jugoinojo ( junior fifth rank , upper grade ) , but was upgraded to jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) on june 0 , 000 .
a written form was ' 率 ' in the taiho code ( the reading was the same ) .
however , there were extensive appointments ; the captain also held the post of major controller , or middle controller , and served concurrently in the inner palace guard ; a captain was sometimes chosen amongst those who were of fifth rank .

a written form was ' 翼 ' in the taiho code ( the reading was the same ) .
an assistant often served concurrently as lesser counselor , and when there was no vacant post for a person who was transferred from the bureau of horses to the inner palace guard , he was temporarily appointed assistant to wait the availability of the post of middle captain .
the most prominent figure that was appointed uhyoe gon no suke ( a substitute post for an assistant in the right division of middle palace guard ) was minamoto no yoritomo .
after yoritomo was appointed to this post at the heiji disturbance , he spent his life as an exile for as long as twenty years ( he was deprived of his official post during that time ) and defeated the taira family .
he retained this post for three decades ( officially ten years in total ) till he was appointed gon dainagon ( substitute major councilor ) in 0000 .
so , yoritomo ' s vassals respectfully called him ' suke dono . '
** jo ( lieutenant )
** there were two posts : ' senior lieutenant ' corresponding to shoshichiinojo ( senior seventh rank , upper grade ) and ' junior lieutenant ' corresponding to jushichiinojo ( junior seventh rank , upper grade ) ; and they were equivalent to ' jo ' out of the shitokan .
in 0000 , the number further increased to twenty five .

in 000 , the number of hyoe was reduced to 000 in the left and right divisions , and then to 000 in 000 .
** there were other posts as follows :
jikicho ( two persons each were assigned to the left and right divisions . )

** in the outer palace precincts , the assigned areas included the following : the outside of the senyo , the jomei , the inmei , and the genki gates ; and the inside of the kenshun , the kenrei , the gishu , and the sakuhei gates .
compared with the other six palace guards , the middle palace guard was assigned especially to important tasks , such as escorting the emperor or keeping a night watch in the imperial palace so , it functioned virtually as a ' bodyguard . '
it also monitored guardsmen selected from the common people so that they could not rebel against the emperor or attack the imperial palace .
it protected the emperor ' s procession .
it also made night patrols around the city of kyoto .
** saio ( the priestess )
** as a traditional event , the kamo-jinja shrine holds the aoi festival , to celebrate when saio presided during her time of service .
since then , the aoi festival has continued , but was discontinued three times during the muromachi , edo , and post war periods .
with the revival of the aoi festival in 0000 , the role of saio dai has been played by an unmarried woman selected from ordinary citizens since 0000 .
the woman selected as saio dai , wears juni hitoe or karaginumoshozoku ( a layered kimono ) , putting on stage make up and having her teeth blackened .
** saiin ( the priestess or the residence of the priestess )
** the origin of saiin
** the saiin priestess system
** saiin and literature
** the end of the saiin
** the name of saiin was given to a priestess who served at the kamo-jinja shrine from the heian to the kamakura period , or at the residence of the priestess .
she was also called kamo no saio or kamo no saiin .
** the origin of the kamo no saiin system was traced back to the early heian period .
after emperor saga ' s side won as a result of the kusuko incident in 000 , emperor saga dedicated his daughter imperial princess uchiko as saio , as he had pledged ; that is probably the beginning of kamo no saiin .
** following the saio ( saigu ) of the ise-jingu shrine , the successive saio priestesses were selected from princesses of blood or female relatives of the emperor ( the imperial family ) .
the priestess stayed there to lead a pure life avoiding buddhist services and impurity , and joined in religious rites held at kamo-jinja shrine or in the official residence of saiin .
the kamo festival on the day of the cock in april was especially important , the saio priestess underwent a purification ceremony , and then visited both the kamo wakeikazuchi-jinja and kamo mioya-jinja shrines to perform religious rites .
** meanwhile , saiin priestesses were not always dismissed when the emperor abdicated the throne , and there were many examples of saiin priestesses remaining in office through more than two emperor regimes .
among them , imperial princess senshi was called " dai saiin " ( great saiin priestess ) because she actually had the longest tenure of saiin over 0 emperors of fifty-six years ( from the times of emperor enyu to emperor goichijo ) .
** during the mid-heian period , saiin constantly became the center for the court culture functioning as an artistic place where tanka poets or the nobles got together .
according to one tradition , fujiwara no shoshi ordered murasaki shikibu to write a new interesting story imperial princess shikishi had asked for ; that was the birth of " the tale of genji . "
the deep cultural relationship between saiin and the imperial court ( especially " kokyu " - the inner palace reserved for women ) can be found in " the pillow book " in a scene where imperial princess senshi and fujiwara no teishi exchange letters .
** it is also particularly noteworthy that hikaru genji ' s cousin , asagao no saiin , who appears in " the tale of genji , " is set up as a saiin priestess from a female relative of the emperor , actually rare in the case of saiin .
saiin and saigu priestesses , or princesses who were former saiin or saigu priestesses often appear in " the tale of sagoromo , " which may suggest that this book was probably written by rokujo saiin no senji , a court lady serving imperial princess baishi .
** although saiin became part of the flourishing court culture , it was often discontinued during the late heian period due to the taira-minamoto war .
after imperial princess reishi was dismissed , the saiin priestess system completely ended due to the turmoil during the jokyu disturbance or lack of finance in the imperial household , and was not restored until recently .
in addition , ' saio dai , ' which has now acquired wide popularity during the aoi festival , literally means the representative of the saio or the saiin priestess , and recalls the good old days of the kamo festival .
** hoshinno
** hoshinno was an imperial prince who became a priest and renounced the world remaining within the imperial court .
also called nudo shinno , hoshi shinno , zenji shinno .
** the origin and transition of hoshinno
** buketenso
** buketenso was one of the job titles within the imperial court from muromachi to the edo period .
the purpose was to transmit petitions of the samurai families to the emperor .
court nobles were appointed to the job .
it was set up during the kenmu restoration , and was institutionalized by the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
** during the muromachi period , the buketenso handled communications between the court nobles and samurai , giving notice of changes in the name of an era , and appointment of a rank .
since yoshimitsu ashikaga had become shogun , buketenso played a role of transmitting the political requirements from the muromachi-dono , or the shogun , to the court .
the function of the buketenso was established after the eisho era in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) .
** during the edo period , two people , the fixed number of positions were appointed by the bakufu and given 000 hyo as an executive allowance and some money or textiles as a salary .
under the control of the edo bakufu , it was set up in 0000 and lasted to the end of the edo period in 0000 .
** the buketenso was appointed as the imperial envoy to the bakufu .
as the bakufu actively intervened into the governing affairs of the imperial court , which became administered by mutual consent amongst the sekkan family ( line of regents and advisers ) , the giso ( position conveying what the congress decides to the emperor ) , and the buketenso .
it was abolished in accordance with the order of imperial restoration .
** junii ( junior second rank )
** junii ( junior second rank ) was a court rank and shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) in japan .
it ranked below shonii ( senior second rank ) and above shosanmi ( senior third rank ) .
** junii
under the ritsuryo system , it was granted mainly to naidaijin ( minister of the center ) , kurodo no betto ( super intendant of the chamberlain ' s office ) , as well as the legal wife of minister .
one of the notable was taira no tokiko , the legal wife of taira no kiyomori , who was granted junii and called nii-no-ama .
** the one in charge of kanrei ( shogunal deputy ) in the muromachi bakufu was promoted up to the rank of sanmi , the kamakura kubo , the ashikaga shogun family , was granted jusanmi .
furthermore , since hideyoshi toyotomi had received an imperial proclamation to become kanpaku ( chief advisor to the emperor ) , and powerful families and their vassals were promoted to junii , some samurai were ranked equal to or higher than nii ( second rank ) .
** yasedoji/yasenodoji/hasedoji
** the yasedoji were considered descendants of oni ( a creature from japanese folklore ) whom dengyo daishi saicho ( buddhist monk named saicho with the posthumous title of dengyo daishi ) employed in doji mura ( village ) as a domestic laborer for the enryaku-ji temple .
those who engaged in the temple chores had their hair hanging loose , were disheveled ; and were like children wearing sandals , so they were called doji ( a child ) .
** to maintain the tradition of the yasedoji , people involved established the yasedoshi-kai ( the association of the yasedoji ) , which collects and keeps related materials .
in the aoi festival , members of the yasedoshi-kai dress up as yotei , recalling the way the yasedoji served as koshi carriers for the emperor .
** history
** based on this legend , many steam baths were later built , and were known as hot spring resorts , mainly for the court nobles after the middle ages in japan .
from the historical viewpoint , the legend concerning prince oama is mostly denied , and the name of yase probably comes from geographical features of the takano river basin .
** the yasedoji were engaged not only in chores at several temples on mt . hiei , but were also carrying koshi ( palanquin ) for the head priests of other temples .
they sometimes carried temple visitors on a palanquin to the top of the mountain and charged fees .
** when emperor godaigo , who had escaped from kyoto , fled to mt . hiei in 0000 , the heads of thirteen families in yasego carried koshi and took up arrows to guard the emperor .
** border dispute with the enryaku-ji temple
** as the yasedoji had common rights on the estate of enryaku-ji temple , they enjoyed the privilege of selling firewood , charcoal or woodwork inside the capital .
** in response , the yasego requested a retraction many times , but it was denied , and then in 0000 , senior councillor , takatomo akimoto , finally made a decision .
people in the yasego felt grateful for his decision , and erected the akimoto-jinja shrine dedicated to akitomo , and held a festival to praise his virtue .
this festival centering on a dedicatory dance called ' shamenchi odori ' ( the shamenchi dance ) is now held ( on sunday preceding the second monday in october every year ) .
** carrier for sokaren ( palanquin on which the emperor ' s coffin is placed )
** after the meiji restoration , they were deprived of the privilege of a land tax exemption ; however , they followed precedent , such that they were granted money equivalent to the amount of land tax from the emperor .
the same principle was applied to the funeral of emperor taisho .
** at the funeral of emperor showa in 0000 , the coffin was carried in a car , and the sokaren was used only to transfer the coffin inside the funeral hall .
the yasedoshi-kai requested that the role of yotei be performed by the yasedoji as in the past ; however , it was rejected because of security reasons , and the imperial guards became yotei in historical costumes .
several members from the yasedoshi-kai served as advisers only when the coffin was transferred from the car to the sokaren .

** the custom of the shugo daimyo following seii taishogun ' s lead was established around the era of yoshimitsu ashikaga , but it is estimated that shobanshu as a status and position was established during the era of eikyo of yoshinori ashikaga .
** moreover , nagayoshi miyoshi , who was originally a vassal of the hosokawa clan , was appointed as shobanshu by yoshiteru ashikaga and , using the authority of this status , assumed control over the shogunate administration acting in the position of kanrei .

** jugo

upon the emperor ' s order , those with the title of jugo received equal treatment to the imperial family although they were vassals .
jugo is also called jusango or jusangu .
** what is jugo ?
** jugo is a title with the meaning of being equal to sango ( sangu ) , which includes the following three titles : taikotaigo ( emperor ' s grandmother ) , kotaigo ( empress dowager ) and kogo ( empress consort ) .
as a kanji character ' 后 ' ( ko ) is used for any of the above three titles in particular , many tend to regard it as a title for women , especially a lady of the imperial family .
however , jugo means being equal to ' ko ' ( empress or queen ) and the title was given to the nobility regardless of sex .
** the emperor ' s declaration of jugo gradually came to be extended to the imperial princes and princesses within the third degree of the imperial kinship .
** when the period of northern and southern courts began , with chikafusa kitabatake being given the title of jugo , even the vassals who were not the emperor ' s maternal relatives started to be given the title of jugo .
as this became a custom , from yoshimitsu ashikaga to the 00th shogun yoshiaki ashikaga , jugo was given to the ashikaga shogun family .
mansai of the sanbo-in and godai-ji temple , who was also called the " chancellor in black " and served as a political advisor under the regime of yoshimochi ashikaga , also became a jugo .

** shoshii ( senior fourth rank )
shoshii was divided into upper and lower , and ranked below jusanmi no ge and above jushiinojo under the ritsuryo system .
** one example of this was shoshiinoge iyo no kami minamoto no yoriyoshi ason .
** however , even if they were ranked shoshii , when they became sangi , and were raised to kugyo , the title of respect was ' ason ' after their surname and ' kyo ' after their imina .
** shoshii was the peak rank , i . e . the highest rank , for a family which was not permitted to ascend to kugyo , and many leading warriors of the seiwa-genji ( minamoto clan ) and kawachi-genji ( minamoto clan ) were prominent .
in the kanmu-heishi ( taira clan ) , taira no tadamori from the ise-heishi ( taira clan ) ascended to shoshii and was named gyobukyo ( official of the ministry of justice ) .
** the government regarded shoshii ( senior fourth rank ) as the first rank awarded to the deputy secretary and those of the rank of general ( taisho ) in the japanese imperial army and navy .
in addition , there are many examples where diet members were awarded a rank between juichii ( junior first rank ) and shoshii ( senior fourth rank ) according to their careers and achievements .

** in this tale , there is some mention of takiguchi soldiers such as ' yamanouchi no shudogyobo no jo tsunetoshi and his son toshitsuna takiguchi ' and ' kusakabe juro daifu sadanao , ( hasuike ) ietsuna takiguchi and ( hasuike ) takiguchi taro ietsugu '
** there is also some mention of takiguchi samurai in ' yugao ' of " the tale of genji " by murasaki shikibu .
** as this man is guarding the takiguchi , that is the eastern gate of the seiryoden , he strikes the bow with an arrow stirringly and shouts repeatedly : ' be aware of fires ! , ' and then leaves for the house of the caretaker .
genji no kimi thought , that the roll call for the night shift was already over and people staying at the takiguchi were now reporting the names . as it was the time of the roll call , it was not yet so late at night .
** jodai ( castellan )
** the jodai is a person who took care of a castle in the absence of the lord .
there are other descriptions such as rusuigashira and orusui .
** the edo bakufu established four jodai for sunpu-jo castle , nijo-jo castle , fushimi-jo castle , and osaka-jo castle ( the jodai for fushimi-jo castle was discontinued in 0000 ) .
** kanto bugyo
** kanto bugyo was a post held by an officer in the kamakura bakufu or muromachi bakufu ( both of which were japanese feudal governments headed by a shogun ) who would confer ranks and titles on gokenin ( immediate vassals of the shogun ) .
** kanto bugyo during the kamakura bakufu :
kanto bugyo was originally set up as a personnel system for the kamakura bakufu .
under the control of the mandokoro ( the administrative and financial branch of the government ) , powerful gokenin who held a hereditary position on the hyojoshu ( the council of state of the kamakura period ) held this post .
** only gokenin of the minamoto clan and the seiwa-genji ( minamoto clan ) were allowed to become kokushi ( a provincial governor ) in the early days of the kamakura bakufu , with ordinary gokenin unable to rise to higher ranks .
there were increasing examples for important tozama gokenin to obtain higher ranks more so than goi ( fifth rank ) , such as :
** the ashikaga clan , who , as the toryo ( the leading warrior ) of the minamoto clan , successfully filled kyoto and large provincial governor posts such as the jibu-no-taifu or chief assistant to the minister of the ceremonies ;
the adachi clan , who filled jobs like akitajo-no-suke ( provincial governor of akita-jo castle in dewa province ) and mutsu no kami ( the governor of mutsu province ) ;
the sasaki clan , who worked as a shugo or hereditary military constable and was appointed to omi no kami ( governor of omi province ) and efu no jo ( lieutenant of the palace guards ) .
** the function of the kanto bugyo in the kamakura bakufu was to manage exclusively the appointment of the ranks for the bakufu to control their samurai .
a gokenin awarding himself a rank of his own accord without obtaining the permission of the kanto bugyo ( and , by extension , the kamakura bakufu ) was called " jiyu-ninkan " ( literally " appointment without consent " ) , and this was subject to punishment .
the first known instance of jiyu-ninkan was committed by minamoto no yoshitsune , who appointed himself kebiishi saemon no jo ( a post which carried the responsibility for maintaining public order and overseeing military affairs in kyoto ) without first obtaining the permission of minamoto no yoritomo .
** kanto bugyo in the muromachi bakufu :
the position of kanto bugyo in the kamakura bakufu was also established in the muromachi bakufu under the control of the court .
the settsu clan , which was descended from the miyoshi clan , succeeded to the hereditary post of kanto bugyo in the muromachi bakufu .
** the system had changed considerably in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
** kyoto daikan
** it was called kyoto gundai in the beginning .
** in 0000 , toyonao gomi was appointed as daikan bugyo ( magistrate ) in kyoto and set up an encampment called kyoto gundai in the west side of the nijo-jo castle , which is allegedly the origin of the kyoto daikan .
at the outset , it dealt with lawsuits in the kinai together with fushimi bugyo and had jurisdiction over kyoto city with the shoshidai , eventually the job became busy .
four years later , duties including that of shoshidai were reorganized , thus the kyoto machibugyo was inaugurated as a new system .
the position was succeeded by toyomune gomi again , however , after his death in 0000 , it was succeeded by masanori kobori , and since then by the kobori clan hereditarily .
** when masanori was in the position , a fief of 000 koku and a 0000 hyo executive allowance , and status of tsutsuji no mazume were set for the kyoto daikan .
as it administered the duties of nijo-jo castle and the court , it had many subordinates numbering about 00 to 00 normally and 00 or more at the most .
** its position and duties are :
administration of the court fief , court nobles , and deputies to collect tax , and so on ,
** maintenance and repair of nijo-jo castle ,
** provision of executive allowance for temples and shrines in kyoto ,
** administration of important points in river traffic in yamashiro province at katsura , kizucho , uji city , kamo , and yodo , and
** administration of the tenryo in yamashiro , settsu , kawachi , and tanba provinces .
also , as a result of negotiation with the osaka machibugyo about management , it held an additional post of osaka funate kaku ( a class of profession in osaka whose role was to be in charge of chartered ship management and maritime inspections ) for a period .
** kyoto mimawariyaku ( a post of kyoto patrols )
** kyoto mimawariyaku was a post established by the edo bakufu to maintain public order in kyoto at the end of the edo period .
the kyoto mimawariyaku retained kyoto mimawariyaku gumi under it .
** the kyoto mimawariyaku gumi was installed on may 00 , 0000 , and the first personnel were hirotaka maita from the asao domain and yasumasa matsudaira , hatamoto ( a direct retainer of a shogun ) .
in later years , chikayoshi hori ( shinano iida domain ) , choen ogasawara ( hatamoto ) and michinori iwata ( hatamoto ) were appointed .
** the rank of the post was obangashira-jiseki ( assistant head of oban ) with 0 , 000 koku ( calculation system based on rice ) of yakudaka ( an allowance ) and 0 , 000 hyo ( sack of rice ) of yakuryo ( an allowance . )
** when yoshinobu tokugawa moved from nijo-jo castle to osaka-jo castle after taiseihokan ( restoration of the imperial regime ) , the mimawariyaku and personnel of lower posts moved to osaka for protection , but later the mimawariyaku naturally disappeared .
** kubo-okura ( financial branch )
** the kubo-okura was the financial branch of the muromachi bakufu , in charge of managing revenues and expenditures .
it was simply called " okura . "
its head called kurabugyo ( okurabugyo ) led the branch but , in fact , nosenkata selected from private doso ( pawnbrokers and moneylenders ) inside kyoto city were commissioned by the kurabugyo to handle accounting .
** in the middle ages there was a high risk of experiencing misfortune , such as disasters and theft .
therefore some samurai warriors , court nobles , and common people living in kyoto tried to avoid such a risk by placing their properties in the custody of the doso , moneylenders such as pawnbrokers , or temples surrounded by well-defended stone walls and fences .
so did the imperial court and the bakufu ( feudal government ) , and for example those who managed money and properties of the imperial court were called kinrimikura .
** the doso and sake brewers that assumed the position of nosenkata temporarily stored collected taxes in their own warehouse before transporting them to the government .
in later years , they took charge of revenue and expenditures under the written order of the bakufu ( steward of the bakufu or kurabugyo ) because doing so saved them transpiration of the tax to the government .
this is believed to be the origin of the kubo-okura ( financial branch ) .
** as the nosenkata was a moneylender , the bakufu , when in financial difficulty , is considered to have borrowed money from it like the general public did .
** when the nosenkata collected the tax and stored it in its warehouse , it sent the government a ' uketori ' ( receipt ) .
when the bakufu requested the okura to disburse from its deposit , an official payment order was issued by the mandokoro and jointly signed by the kurabugyo .
in later years , this system was simplified ; an ' uketori ' ( receipt ) prepared by mandokoro was sent to the okura along with a ' shitagaki ' prepared by the kurabugyo to substitute for the written order .
** onshogata ( office for administering reward grants )
** onshogata in kenmu government
** onshogata in the muromachi bakufu
** the onshogata was a department set up in the kenmu government and the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , which took charge of desk work relating to administering onsho award ( reward grants ) .
** emperor godaigo overthrew the kamakura bakufu in 0000 and set up the onshogata to deliberate , investigate , and administer onsho awards , appointing three people , saneyo toin , fujifusa madenokoji and mitsutsune kujo , as the shokei ( a high rank portfolio ) .
although the new administration had overthrown the kamakura bakufu , it was essential for the administration without its own military force , to reward warriors , who participated in the coup to overthrow the kamakura bakufu , so as to prevent them from plotting a breakaway .
with no organs to deal with the lawsuits , the onshogata was inundated with work related to the lawsuits , and in turn , the work of awarding onsho became confusing .
** in 0000 , the administration introduced a system called yon-ban-sei , under which the whole country was grouped into four regions and a tonin ( the director ) was appointed for each .
sadafusa yoshida ( tonin for the tokaido and tosando regions )
mitsutsune kujo ( tonin for the hokurikudo region )
fujifusa madenokoji ( tonin for the kinai , sanyodo and sanindo regions )
takasuke shijo ( tonin for the nankaido and saikaido regions )
were appointed to the tonin , and masashige kusunoki and nagatoshi nawa were appointed to the yoryudo ( officer of the government ) .
concurrently holding the posts of tonin and yoryudo of zasso-ketsudansho ( agency of kenmu government to file lawsuits ) , they were expected to cooperate with each other .
** takauji ashikaga and his fellows , however , declined appointments to the posts in the onshogata .
meanwhile , a judicial bureaucrat from the overthrown bakufu , a yoryudo of zasso-ketsudansho , was excluded from the onshogata .
when emperor godaigo refused fujifusa madenokoji , who gave candid advice to the emperor about his ultimate decision , fujifusa absconded and quit the government , and as a result the onshogata stopped functioning .
although the denso-shu ( a consultation form of denso - the job to relay messages of court ' s people to the emperor ) took charge of the work of awarding onsho shortly , it was not long before the kenmu government collapsed .
** ultimate decision made by takauji was called ' goonsata . '
** yoshiakira ashikaga , who took the initiative in reconstructing the bakufu and later became the second seii taishogun , designed the reconstruction work with setting a strategic base in the onshogata , and later presided over a council called gozensata at the onshogata .
** during the rule of yoshinori ashikaga , separated from the onshogata , the gozensata was incorporated in the center of the bakufu , and the onshogatashu was generally called ' gozensatashu ' or ' gozenbugyonin ' ( bugyonin with qualifications for attending the gozensata ) .
the onshogata was also changed into an office for the gozensata in reality and occupied by the bugyonin , the reserve members of gozensatashu .
** nosenkata ( an institution to collect taxes from moneylenders and sake breweries )
** taxation on the doso and sakaya by the muromachi bakufu
** establishment of the nosenkata
** tokuseirei ( ordering the return of land sold and the dissolution of debts ) and fiscal reconstruction
** decline of the muromachi bakufu and the nosenkata
** in kyoto , the doso and sakaya had developed rapidly since the latter part of the kamakura period .
leading buddhist temples such as enryaku-ji temple , as well as the miki no kami ( chief of the sake office , the oshikoji family took charge for generations ) in the imperial court , had collected taxes from the doso and sakaya by dominating them .
** therefore , the muromachi bakufu tried to cover the financial shortage by collecting taxes from the doso and sakaya , and started to exclude the clout of other influential families using the military force employed for keeping the peace in kyoto city .
** dominating the doso and sakaya , the bakufu initially tried to collect taxes directly from individual traders , but their efficiency was poor .
the person responsible was nosenkata .
reflecting the importance of the dosoyaku and sakayayaku on the bakufu finance in those days , the word " goryosho " was often used for the nosenkata , though the " goryosho " originally indicated the territory directly controlled by the bakufu .
** some doso in the nosenkata were appointed to the officer of the kubo-okura ( finance branch ) .
** there had been drastic changes since the period of the sixth shogun yoshinori ashikaga .
whenever the tokuseirei was issued after peasant uprisings , the bakufu had to exempt the seriously damaged doso from the dosoyaku payment to save them .
as a result , the income from the nosenkata fell into arrears and the shogun ' s daily life was threatened .
consequently , it is believed that the bakufu finance was kept comparatively stable until immediately before the onin war despite losing its authority .
** after the onin war , with the devastation of kyoto city and refusal of tax payment , the tax income did not reach the expected income calculated on the basis of the contract system , and as a result the bakufu finances went into the red .
in addition , not a few people refused to be a nosenkata .
harumoto however refused their request .
in 0000 , demanding the same privileges as ' shojitsubo , ' ' gyokusenbo , ' a long-established doso similar to ' shojitsubo , ' filed a lawsuit only to lose .
** naidankata
** at the beginning of the muromachi bakufu , seii taishogun ( great general ) takauji ashikaga entrusted his real younger brother tadayoshi ashikaga with a civil administration and a part of the military administration .
tadayoshi had managed the shomusata by establishing the hikitsukekata ( adjudication office ) based on an old system adopted by the kamakura bakufu , however the business became gradually complicated .
furthermore , he was annoyed by a feud with ko no moronao , a main retainer of the ashikaga clan .
** therefore , tadayoshi abolished the hikitsukekata and instead established the naidankata .
dividing the national land into three regions , the bakufu set up an office in each region , and appointed ko no moronao , tomosada uesugi ( the futahashi uesugi family ) and shigeyoshi uesugi as the tonin ( the director ) .
they each managed the shomusata with ten subordinate yoryudo ( officer of the bakufu ) .
in the original hikitsukekata , the discussion and the shogun ' s ultimate decision-making ( tadayoshi made decision on behalf of shogun takauji ) on the settled items were thoroughly separated .
moreover , it is said that tadayoshi tried to ensure his authority in decision making by gathering bushi ( group of warriors ) supporting him to the naidankata , aiming to keep moronao in check .
** consequently , in spite of success in enhancing its political influence on the shomusata , the muromachi bakufu could not achieve another goal of putting a period to the confrontation between tadayoshi and moronao , it rather deteriorated .
murder of captive shigeyoshi uesugi by moronao forced the naidankata to stop functioning only five years after its establishment .
it was not long before the naidankata was effectively abolished because gokenin ( vassal of the shogunate ) belonged to the tadayoshi group , the main members of the naidankata , left the bakufu .
** nenyo ( one of the positions in the in ' s or retired emperor ' s ) office
** nenyo ( inshi )
** nenyo ( temples )
** the nenyo was an official position during the middle ages in japan .
** the nenyo is an official position in the inshi ( officials of the in no cho , or retired emperor ' s office )
the nenyo supervised the in no cho ( retired emperor ' s office ) and took the responsibility for running administrative affairs in the in .
the zuryo ( head of the provincial governors ) of the fourth or fifth court ranks worked as a betto ( chief administrator ) , which was commonly called " innonenyo " or " nenyo betto . "
in later years , some stewards or regents served concurrently as nenyo .
prominent nenyo includes fujiwara no mototaka under emperor shirakawa , fujiwara no tadataka under emperor toba , fujiwara no toshimori under emperor goshirakawa , and taira no tadamori under bifukumon-in .
** the nenyo is an official position in temples such as the todai-ji temple , to-ji temple , and the kongobu-ji temple .
the nenyo organized meetings and consultations of the daishu ( buddhist monks residing in the zendo ) by arranging and chairing the meetings and recording , storing and putting into practice what was decided in the meetings .
they were elected from the daishu by drawing lots or held the position by rotation once a year .
enjo-ji temple set up the nenyo position in 000 , which was the oldest historical record of the position .
** this practice of assigning nenyo in temples had an influence on samurai warriors in later years .
** shokei ( court novels who work at the imperial court in high ranking posts )
** when the shokei is referred to in connection with important events for the imperial court such as daijosai ( first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned emperor ) and kamo festival , he worked as the director and ran such events .
the jimoku ( ceremony for appointing officials ) assigned . nobles of higher ranks as an assistant of the head depending on how important the event was .

** kokushi ( provincial governor )
** history
** in medieval japan , a kokushi was a government officer who was sent by the central government to administer a ryoseikoku ( an area of regional administration ) .
** gunji ( district officials ) were appointed by influential people from the region , namely former gozoku ( local ruling clan ) members .
for these reasons , the kokushi were pivotal to central government control .
a kokushi ' s tenure was six ( subsequently four ) years .
a kokushi performed his duties in the kokuga ( provincial government office ) .
he had supreme authority in the area under his jurisdiction and was responsible for all matters pertaining to religious services , administration , the law and the military .
** the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) records how the kokushi system was introduced by imperial decree at the time of the taika reforms .
at this time there were no plans to distribute kokushi uniformly throughout the country .
from this point on until the end of the 0th century , kokushi were placed throughout the country following the establishment of the ryoseikoku system .
** in the early 0th century , the taiho ritsuryo ( taiho code ) - a fully-fledged system of law - was issued , and the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) was established .
kokushi occupied a very important position in the ritsuryo system .
the handen shuju system ( a system for periodically reallocating rice land ) was the basis of the ritsuryo system and involved the creation of the ancient family registry system , the allotment of rice fields and the collection of tax/corvee , all tasks carried out by the kokushi .
in this way , the kokushi were entrusted with spreading the ideas of the ritsuryo system throughout japan .
** in the heian period , the imperial court revised the system for governing local areas .
the main responsibility of the kokushi became the collection of a fixed amount of tax , and they were relieved of the duty of governing , a duty which had been part of the ritsuryo system .
this was because it became possible to collect these taxes without relying on the ritsuryo system of governance .
the kokushi were able to secure the fixed amount of taxes by entrusting the tato with the management of and collection of taxes from the myoden ( the tato so entrusted were known as fumyo ) .
under the ritsuryo system , tax was levied on each individual so it was necessary to administer each person individually .
however , as described above , around the 00th century a system was established for levying tax on myoden or , in other words , on land ( this system was known as the myo taisei ) .
** when a fixed amount of tax had been secured , several kokushi appeared from outside the area ( these were known as yonin ) .
the head of the kokushi who were assigned to and resided in a province became known as the zuryo .
** at that time , it was mainly middle-ranking royalty who were assigned to be kokushi .
furthermore , a kokushi assignment was directly connected to the accumulation of wealth , so middle-ranking royalty fought for the appointments and also sought to be reappointed .
" makura no soshi " ( the pillow book ) includes a description of the day when a person was assigned to kokushi ( the assigning ceremony is called a jimoku ) .
in the middle and later periods of the heian period , the chigyo-koku system ( see the next sentence ) was established .
** kokushi existed in the kamakura period as well .
however , the bakufu ( military government ) dispatched jito ( estate stewards ) to several areas , and these jito became actively involved in the shoen ( manors ) and the kokugaryo ( public lands ) administered by the kokushi .
naturally , the kokushi resisted this situation .
however , jito made inroads into kokugaryo , depriving kokushi of their right to control the provinces .
** shugo ( provincial constables ) were granted substantial rights entering the muromachi period , for example the hanzei kyufu ( the right to collect half the tax from an area ) and the shisetsu jungyo ( the right to settle land disputes on behalf of the bakufu ) .
these rights also exerted a strong effect in the kokugaryo lands administered by the kokushi , resulting in a substantial transferal of kokushi rights to the shugo .
** in this way , the kokushi became government officers in name only and real power shifted to the shugo ( these people were known as shugo daimyo ( shugo lords ) ) .
the kokushi evolved to become only an honorary post .
therefore , the role of kokushi was appointed to someone irregardless of whether they were in control of the province or not .
during the sengoku ( warring states ) period , many people such as busho ( warlords ) appointed themselves kokushi or pretended to be kokushi .
while real political power was in the samurai class , for example , in a bakufu , kokushi was only a honorary post .
in this era , daimyo in the sengoku period actively donated money or other valuables to the imperial court in order to secure a kokushi post .
this situation allowed the emperor to be recognized again as having a position of power .
** in the azuchi-momoyama period , as hideyoshi toyotomi took the position of kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) , the title of kokushi changed into an official post for a samurai family to show the level of its social position or authority and became completely nominal .
after the edo bakufu was established , the bakufu recommended to the imperial court that a daimyo should be appointed to kokushi , according to the social standing of his family .
there were also many cases of normal samurai appropriating the kokushi title as their own personal name ( this act was known as hyakan-na ) .
this tradition continued until the meiji restoration .
** classification of province ranks
this classification changed according to the situation surrounding the provinces and times .
** shinno ninkoku ( provinces whose gubernatorial posts were reserved as sinecures for imperial princes )
for more details , refer to the ' shinno ninkoku ' page .
** the emperor kammu had many children , and many of these princes were given official posts as kokushu ( governor ) .
some provinces known as shinno ninkoku always had princes appointed as kokushi , and these princes were known as taishu ( governor-generals ) .
it is said that the actual works of the head governor were handled by its suke ( his deputy ) .
** sengoku daimyo ( japanese territorial lord in the sengoku period )
** summary
** origins
** control
** the term sengoku daimyo refers to a daimyo who exercised unitary control over several districts or provinces during japan ' s sengoku ( warring states ) period .
** compared with shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) in the muromachi period , daimyo in the sengoku period centralized control of territories , which were not under the influence of the central government .
in particular , sengoku daimyo strengthened their control over hikan ( low-level bureaucrats ) and kashin ( vassals ) , and established the kandakasei system , a system for imposing military duties in return for chigyo daka ( a stipend based on a fief ' s rice production ) .
some daimyo in the period established bunkokuho ( the laws to be enforced in their own territories ) to mediate disputes between hikan and vassals or among residents in their territories .
the highly independent and solid territory control system employed by daimyo in the sengoku period is called the daimyo-ryogoku system .
it is said that the control style of this system was reached by increasing the level of central control in the shugo-ryogoku system ( the system in which a shugo controlled a province ) .
** many daimyo in the sengoku period were appointed to shugo by the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to establish their own legitimacy so as to surpass adjacent daimyo .
based on this , some people view sengoku daimyo as being sengoku-period shugo .
in order to legitimize their control or gain an advantage over neighboring daimyo , many sengoku daimyo gave substantial donations to the imperial court in return for an official title ( these titles reserved for samurai were known as buke kani ) .
in this situation , the authority of emperor , having been on the brink of ruin , came to be recognized again .
the emperor at the time played no small role in unifying the entire nation around the end of the sengoku period to the azuchi-momoyama period .
** daimyo in the sengoku period advanced the level of independent control over their territories significantly , which decentralized control of the nation .
however , the unification of the nation by nobunaga oda and hideyoshi toyotomi brought the nation under centralized control , making activities by sengoku period daimyo less independent .
under these circumstances , sengoku daimyo made the transition to being early-modern daimyo in the shogunate system .
** the origins of daimyo in the sengoku period are roughly as follows :
additionally , there were also many sengoku daimyo who were originally bakufu officers or ronin ( masterless samurai ) , such as the gohojo and saito clans ) .
there were some who were originally kokushi ( like the uesugi or kitabatake clans , who held both shugo and kanrei ( shogunal deputy ) positions ) and others who were originally court royals ( such as the tosaichijo clan ) .
** a daimyo in the sengoku period was completely in control of his territory .
being highly independent , each of these territories could be called a regional nation .
a daimyo in the sengoku period organized persons in the kokujin ( local samurai ) or hikan ( low-level bureaucrats ) class as his vassals and made them live around his base place to form a castle town .
in this way , the daimyo dissolved or weakened the relations of power between the kokujin/hikan class and the land/general populace .
as well as imposing military duties on the local populace in exchange for maintaining order , the daimyo also established a new taxation system after carrying out a land survey .
some daimyo established bunkokuho as a base for mediating disputes among persons in the kokujin and hikan classes and other disputes in their territories .
this territory control system employed by daimyo in the sengoku period is called the daimyo-ryogoku system .
** however , the authority of daimyo in the sengoku period was not always unlimited .
power of daimyo in the sengoku period was based on the persons in the kokujin or hikan class who were organized as his vassals .
the uprisings that spread across japanese society during the muromachi period also spread to the kokujin and hikan classes .
therefore , persons in the kokujin and hikan classes established an alliance to form a kokujin uprising in order to retain their rights .
the existence of daimyo in the sengoku period was supported by the uprising-based relationships formed by persons in the kokujin and hikan classes .
some daimyo who couldn ' t protect the interests of the kokujin/hikan classes were removed from power , a situation which was known as gekokujo ( people of lower standing overthrowing their social superiors ) .
** shishiki
** the shishiki ( shishoku ) represents the ranking or social status of samurai families in the muromachi period .
** in fact , however , the military police director was often also chosen from the toki clan , a ruling clan in mino province , along with these four clans , which therefore needs to be included as a " shishiki " clan .
** members of the shishiki clans participated in political affairs of the muromachi government as principal retainers of the bakufu along with the three clans ( hosokawa , shiba and hatakeyama clans ) from which shugun ' s deputies were chosen .

jitos ( land stewards ) were chosen from among immediate vassals of the shogunate who lived in local territories in order to manage land and peasants directly by supervising the military affairs , police forces , tax collection and administration of manors and imperial territories .
during the edo period , feudal lords were also called jito .
** ( signature by yoritomo )
i hereby appoint tadahisa koremune , third-ranked officer of the left division of middle palace guards , as the jito of a manor in ise province .
the territory has been ruled by the group led by taira no nobukane , former governor of dewa province .
however , since nobukane rose up in rebellion , an order was issued to hunt down and kill him .
therefore , in accordance with precedents , i hereby assign tadahisa koremune as the new jito of the territory .
let him promptly perform his duty .
that is an order .
june 00 , 0000
** the above is an official document written by minamoto no yoritomo in order to appoint tadahisa koremune as the land steward of the hase imperial territory in ise province .
** the guarantee given by the bakufu to protect a hereditary territory ruled by its vassal was known as " honryo-ando " ( assurance of territorial rights ) , while the allocation of a new territory by the government was called " shinon-kyuyo " ( territory allocation ) .
both these procedures were put into effect by appointing vassals as land stewards .
a vassal appointed as a land steward of a territory was not provided with the territory itself , but only the authority to control and rule the territory .
in a certain sense , therefore , land stewards were ruled not only by the bakufu but also by manorial lords and imperial government officials .
in fact , there was a provision in the code for samurai established by the bakufu ( known as " goseibai shikimoku " ) that land stewards who failed to collect taxes for manorial lords should be dismissed .
** however , the bakufu alone had the right to appoint and discharge land stewards and neither manorial lords nor imperial government officials had any such right .
consequently , land stewards used their position to gradually seize the power to control and rule manors and imperial territories by various means , including promoting farming .
taking advantage of this system , land stewards came to establish effective control of manors and imperial territories .
** since land stewards often failed to pay agreed amounts of taxes to manorial lords or imperial officials even under this subcontract system , some manors and imperial territories were divided between land stewards and manorial lords or imperial officials .
** land steward possessed land under their direct management ( called " horiuchi , " etc . ) around their residences .
since it was customary for residences to be exempted from taxation during the heian and kamakura periods , land stewards took advantage of this custom to place land around their residences under their direct management .
yields from these pieces of land were treated as land stewards ' income .
** the spread of subcontracting practices , boundary drawing and increase in directly managed land show the establishment of land stewards ' right to control land ( right to appropriate land ) in manors and imperial territories .
despite the opposition by manorial lords against their encroachment , land stewards generally gained greater power as time went on .
the encroachment by land stewards gradually resulted in their monopolization of land and led to the dissolution of the system of manors and imperial territories .
** the word " jito " originally meant " field workers " who were in charge of the on-site management and security enforcement of manors and imperial territories .
many land stewards lived in the territories to which they were assigned to manage local affairs on the ground .
however , powerful vassals of the kamakura family who were appointed as land stewards also held important government posts , and since they had to serve the shogun in person , many of them continued to live in kamakura .
these powerful vassals sent their relatives or retainers to local territories so as to have them manage local affairs on the ground .
territories left in the hands of relatives often caused disputes between vassals ( legitimate heirs ) and these relatives ( illegitimate children ) over these territories , and in such cases , relatives were sometimes allowed to succeed as land stewards .
** land stewards differed from manorial lords in the way they managed local affairs .
being warriors , land stewards often resorted to arms when settling disputes .
the well-known petition of peasants of the ategawa manor in kii province is a document written by peasants to complain to their manorial lord about the delay in the payment of annual taxes ( lumber ) caused by wrongful actions by the land steward of their territory .
the document describes how the land steward conscripted peasants for forced labor by threatening to " cut off the ears and noses " of resistant peasants and to " cut the hair of their wives to make them nuns . "
there is also a japanese saying that jito and whining children are the hardest people in the world to reason with .
** during the reign of the taira clan in the late heian period , there were a few cases where samurai retainers of the taira clan were appointed as jito for the on-site management of territories , but the actual situations and duties of these jito are not known .
** however , by being appointed as land stewards by the government of yoritomo which ruled the kanto region , they were recognized as independent territorial rulers .
** these incidents are recorded in " azuma kagami " ( official history of the kamakura bakufu ) and " gyokuyo " ( diary of kanezane kujo , an inspector of documents for the emperor ) .
however , due to the fragmentary nature of the descriptions and differences between the descriptions in the two documents , opinions differ as to the officially recognized definition of the duties of these newly created positions .
** however , after the retired emperor goshirakawa died in 0000 , the practice of appointing land stewards gradually spread to other territories as well .
** as a result of the victory in the jokyu war in 0000 , the kamakura bakufu forfeited about 0 , 000 territories from the imperial court .
these territories were located in the western part of japan , and many gokenin moved to the forfeited territories in western japan as new jito .
these newly appointed land stewards were called " shinpo jito " ( new land stewards ) , while the existing ones were called " honpo jito " ( hereditary land stewards ) .
likewise , rules regarding the tax shares of newly appointed land stewards were called " shinpo rippo " ( new taxation rules ) and their details were as follows :
** one cho ( approximately one hectare ) out of every eleven cho of farmland was given to land stewards as their property exempted from annual taxes paid to manorial lords or imperial officials .
** the right to collect five sho ( approximately 0 . 00 bushels ) of rice per tan ( approximately 00 ares ) of farmland was given to newly appointed land stewards .
** profits from mountains , fields , rivers and seas were split between land stewards , manorial lords and imperial officials .
** one-third of the property of a criminal arrested by a land steward was given to the latter .
** it was like that .
however , local customs and precedents were given priority over these newly adopted rules .
some of the hereditary land stewards who were also appointed as new land stewards subsequently tried to apply newly adopted rules to their old tax shares , thereby causing problems .
** the main duty of provincial military governor during the kamakura period was to exercise military and police power , and they were not given the authority to manage economic affairs .
this was the reason why local land stewards were able to expand their influence to manors and imperial territories .
** however , provincial military governors were accorded the right to collect half of annual taxes and to settle disputes over property during the muromachi period , which greatly increased their economic authority .
based on newly gained economic power , provincial military governors strengthened their influence within their territories in order to subjugate land stewards , soldiers , village headmen and other influential people and to place them under their own control .
** however , land stewards in these later periods are different in nature from those in previous periods .
** during the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , the title " jito " continued to be used in satsuma and osumi provinces , which were ruled by the shimazu and kimotsuki clans .
the title continued to be used in these areas even in the edo period , when they became part of the satsuma domain .
** initially , land stewards moved to live in local communities that they were assigned to .
this type of steward system is known as " full-time ( or live-in ) steward " system ( " kyo jito " in japanese ) .
from the kanei era ( early 00th century ) onward , it became common for executives of the satsuma domain to be concurrently appointed as land stewards , and these executives continued to live in areas around kagoshima-jo castle even during their tenure of office as land stewards .
these land stewards were called " part-time stewards " ( " kakemochi jito " in japanese ) .
** the title continued to be used even in the early meiji period .
it is also known that an indigenous samurai ( called " goshi " in japanese ) was hired as the land steward of ijuin village during the meiji period .
** the duties of land stewards during the edo period were almost the same as those of local governors in the kanto region appointed by the edo bakufu .
in the satsuma domain , land was divided into two categories - i . e . private land owned by the retainers of the domain and land directly managed by the lord of the domain - and land stewards were allocated to the latter category of land .
the biggest difference with local governors appointed by the edo bakufu was that most of the village land stewards in the satsuma domain were executives of the domain , including chief retainers , lord chamberlains , commissioners of finance and town magistrates , who were concurrently appointed as jito .
** the actual administration of village affairs was delegated to the upper-class indigenous samurai .
deputy land stewards were sent out to some of the villages .
** according to ' sanshu gochisei yoran ' ( summary history of satsuma , osumi and hyuga provinces ) , low ranking samurai who served as lackeys and servants were given the privilege of being promoted to the rank of hereditary guard if they were appointed as land stewards .
in order to be promoted to the rank of hereditary guard , it was necessary to hold a post higher than secretary or assume a position with an income to support 00 persons or more for three successive generations .
however , being concurrently appointed as a land steward gave the privilege of being promoted to the rank of hereditary guard in a single generation .
also , a territory with no successive jito was called ' meisho ' ( 明所 ) , and it was put under the control of oban gashira ( captains of the great guards ) .
for example , hisakaze shimazu was concurrently appointed as the land steward of izumi village twice while he was serving also as the land steward of kaseda village .
** the tile " jitoshiki " continued to be used in the obi domain as well .
the land steward of kiyotake town , who represented the lord of the domain in kiyotake , a pivotal territory in the north-eastern part of the obi domain , was of particularly importance .
in addition kiyotake jito ( kiyotake land steward ) , titles such as sakatani jito , kitagawachi jito , aburatsu-ko port jito and odotsu jito are found in the obi domain ' s register of vassals recorded in 0000 .
in the obi domain , land stewards were chosen from among samurai retainers living in areas around the castle as in the satsuma domain .
however , the land steward of kiyotake was chosen from among horse guards ( called " umamawari " in japanese ) , while land stewards of other territories were chosen from among middle ranking retainers who served as servants or low ranking foot soldiers .
** ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system )
** ryoge no kan during the tang dynasty ( china )
** ryoge no kan in japan
** ryoge no kan was a newly established government post which was not defined within the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
government officials managed by ryoge no kan were also referred to as ryoge no kanshi .
** ryoge no kan posts were created in order to respond quickly and flexibly to real political issues regardless of the existing ritsuryo system and organization of the government in japan .
ryoge no kan posts were first established in china , and many more were created from the early to middle eighth century .
many ryoge no kan posts were created in japan toward the end of the eighth century when the reforms of emperor kanmu took place .
later on , several more ryoge no kan posts were created in order to adapt to reality .
** on the other hand , it was also observed that government posts quintessential to a government organization and government posts that were created only as needed coexisted , sometimes resulting in an overlapping of posts .
in spite of these problems , no major changes were made to the system in the early tang dynasty period .
this resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of government officials .
** genso ( tang ) appeared in the early eighth century and changed the policy on increasing the number of officials which had continued since busokuten ' s era and tried to restrain their numbers .
during that period , however , the ritsuryo system had lost touch with realities in society producing a need to adapt .
therefore , there was need for quickly responding to such a reality .
in response , from the genso period on , government posts defined in the ritsuryo system and separate government posts , in other words ryoge no kan , were newly established one after another .
many ryoge no kan posts were given a name ending with the suffix " -shi " or called " shishoku " in order to make a contrast between them and government posts defined in the ritsuryo system .
** as the mercenary system had replaced the fuheisei , military expenses continued to rise in order to ensure a sufficient amount of soldiers .
furthermore , for administrative inspection purposes , government posts such as kansatsushi ( inspector ) , azechi ( inspector of provincial governments ) and saihoshi ( auditor ) were also created .
as ryoge no kan posts were being created whenever the need arise , they gradually came to have more control over administrative activities than the officials within the ritsuryo government .
** as a result , government official posts under the ritsuryo system became an empty shell .
ryoge no kan posts gradually become overabundant and the number of private citizens assigned as shori ( officials responsible for practical works ) increased .
while appointed ritsuryo government officials needed to be approved by the emperor , the kami ( director ) had a free hand to appoint shori into posts or ryoge no kan .
as a result , wealthy people and country squires who had the financial wherewithal assumed posts of shori .
this caused the rise of country squires ( shitaifu ) in the end of tang dynasty period .
** as it became the eighth century , large-scale administrative reforms were conducted by emperor kanmu due to the loosening of the ritsuryo system .
after the emperor kanmu reforms , ryoge no kan posts were actively placed in order to fix the flaws in the organization of the government in accordance with the ritsuryo code .
** kageyushi ( board of discharge examiners ) , which was placed by emperor kanmu in 000 , was responsible for inspecting the local administrations of kokushi ( provincial governors ) .
in the early ninth century , emperor saga newly created the kurododokoro ( board of archivists ) ( also known as kurodo no to ( head chamberlain ) ) in 000 which was responsible for handling classified documents as a secretary of the emperor .
emperor saga also placed kebiishi ( police and judicial chief ) in 000 in order to maintain security and handle civil affairs .
in the 00th century as wealthy people appeared in local areas , security deteriorated due to territorial disputes .
consequently , posts of oryoshi ( suppressor ) and tsuibushi ( envoys to pursue and capture ) were established with the role of a local security police .
furthermore , kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) who assisted the emperor was placed in 000 .
other ryoge no kan posts included the sessho ( regent ) , who acted as the emperor and nairan ( private audience ) , who could preliminarily inspect official documents submitted from the great council of state to the emperor .
** from the middle of the heian period , the northern house of the fujiwara clan assumed these posts from generation to generation and took the regency .

** cases of families that served as kotaiyoriai at an earlier time .
** kotaiyoriai ( 交代寄合） is one instance of having hatamoto ( a direct retainer of a shogun ) family status within the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
in a broad sense , the status was the same as a high-ranking retainer ( hatamoto yoriaiseki ) that also meant being a direct vassal of the shogun .
unlike hatamoto yoriaiseki who had continuous residence in edo , kotaiyoriai participated in a system called sankinkotai which obligated feudal lords to reside in edo every other year to show their loyalty to the shogunate .
** the term kotaiyoriai appeared in bukan ( a book of heraldry ) , published for the first time in 0000 .
it is reported that among kotaiyoriai members , twenty families were given a special high rank called omotemuki onreishu between 0000 and 0000 .
** although the stipend for a kotaiyoriai was less than ten thousand koku ( crop yields ) , they were treated as " taishin hatamoto " ( hatamoto with high rank and high yields ) and permitted to practice sankinkotai like daimyo feudal lords .
while hatamotoyoriai ( hatamoto meetings ) were dominated by wakadoshiyori ( a managerial position in edo bakufu ) , kotaiyoriai meetings were lead by the roju ( members of the shogun ' s council of elders ) .
even though kotaiyoriai used the same anteroom seats ( shikoseki ) in edo-jo castle as feudal lords and direct retainers of the shogun , they held no official position in the government .
all retainers were paid a yoriai oyakukin ( stipend ) in lump sum twice a year in february and august at a proportion of two units of ryo ( unit of gold currency ) for each 000 koku ( crop yield ) .
** kotaiyoriai members were composed of local ruling families with a long and distinguished history , branch families of daimyo feudal lords , successors to a daimyo family name thus undergoing a change in rank , etc .
aside from a few cases , kotaiyoriai did not have an official rank unless they were appointed one , the same as any other hatamoto retainer .

** umamawari ( horse guards )
** summary
** the umamawari was established in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) and was a job based on the government service system for samurai families .
horse guards were mounted samurai retainers who accompanied commanders ' horses as their bodyguards and served as messengers or soldiers in wars .
they also served as bodyguards for feudal lords ( daimyo in japanese ) and performed administrative duties as their aides or deputies .
** horse guards were called differently by different daimyo families , and among them , those who served the gohojo clan are particularly well known .
nobunaga oda ' s horse guards , just like pages who served him , were chosen from among the second and third sons of local ruling families and played important roles as nobunaga ' s aides .
elites among nobunaga ' s horse guards and pages were chosen as his personal bodyguards known as " red guards " and " black guards " and many of these bodyguards were promoted to the position of troop commander .
** horse guards continued to exist during the edo period as part of the staff organization of various domains and served feudal lords as bodyguards in their daily lives .
under the government service system of the edo bakufu , shoinban ( castle guards ) and koshogumi ( page corps ) called ryoban were equivalent to the umamawari in many domains .
a child of the tokugawa shogunate ' s direct vassal ( called " hatamoto " in japanese ) was normally appointed as either a castle guard or a page and served as an aide of the shogun before starting out on his career as a shogunate government official .
** in various feudal domains , the word " umamawari " ( horse guard ) was used not only as an occupational title but also to describe family status or ranks .
some domains allowed umamawari personnel to ride horses to perform their duties while others did not , and it is difficult to tell which of these practices was more common .
in some domains , the words " kyunin " and " umamawari " were both used to express occupational titles or family ranks , while in others only one of these words was used .
in a domain where both kyunin and umamawari existed due to family status or rank , the kyunin were superior to the umamawari .
umamawari personnel who were not allowed to ride horses were equivalent to escorts ( called " kojunin " ) of the tokugawa shogunate - they were middle-ranking retainers that were allowed to have an audience with their lords but not allowed to ride horses .
** in domains where umamawari were allowed to ride horses , families with the umamawari status were mostly lower-ranking families among upper-class retainers in the broad sense .
the umamawari of the asano clan of the ako domain , well known for the ako incident during the genroku era , were typical examples of this type of umamawari .
they were regarded as a class of mounted retainers higher in rank than grooms or stablemen called " nakakosho , " who were not allowed to ride horses .
of the forty-seven ako samurai , fifteen were umamawari , including takesune horibe , and these fifteen members were all earning incomes of 000 to 000 koku .
although they were not necessarily chief retainers , they all had incomes for upper-class retainers .
there was a profound difference between these retainers and middle-ranking retainers who were not allowed to ride horses - tadao otaka , a middle-ranking retainer with the largest income , only had an income of 00 koku .

** living national treasure is a japanese popular term for individuals certified as preservers of important intangible cultural properties by the minister of education , culture , sports , science and technology based on the law for the protection of cultural properties .
the term " living national treasure " is not formally recognized by the law , but is an informal term used as a reference to cultural properties designated as the national treasures of japan .
** living national treasure is a term for those designated as holders of important intangible cultural property .
intangible cultural properties of special importance are designated as " important intangible cultural properties " by the minister of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( article 00 , section 0 ) ( for further information , see the section on important intangible cultural property ) .
in other words , intangible cultural property refers to certain ' art , ' such as arts and crafts or performing arts .
individuals or groups have attained a high level of mastery in certain skills .
individuals or groups who have attained mastery in certain skills can be certified by the japanese government as the preservers of their art and they receive support to ensure their continuation .
** there are three types of certifications for individuals or groups who hold important intangible cultural property : ' individual certification , ' ' general certification , ' and ' preservation group certification . '
individual certification is given to individual holders , general certification is given to holders as an organized group , and preservation group certification is given to the holders of a group .
within the three types of certification , those referred to as ' living national treasure ' is generally limited to those holding individual certification .
those who are given general certification or preservation group certification are generally not referred to as a living national treasure .
** individual certification

** jisha-bugyo
** summary
** kamakura and muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun )
** edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun )
** reference
** jisha-bugyo was one of the shogunate administrators in military government from the muromachi to edo eras , and was in charge of temples and shrines .
** in kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , officials who were in charge of temples and shrines were called " jisha-bugyo . "
other bugyo were set up to negotiate and mediate with certain strong temples and shrines .
in december , 0000 ( lunar calendar ) , kageyoshi oba and others were appointed as bugyo in charge of temples and shrines supported by kamakura bakufu , such as tsurugaoka hachiman-gu shrine and shochoju-in temple .
** this policy was continued by the kenmu government and the muromachi bakufu .
in the muromachi bakufu , jisha-bugyo was subdivided into temple-bugyo ( in charge of buddhist temples ) and shake-bugyo ( in charge of shrines ) .
after yoshimitsu ashikaga , special bugyo were appointed proactively as bugyo in charge of special temples and shrines , by the bugyoshu ( group of magistrates ) .
these special bugyo were at the height of their power in the reign of yoshimasa ashikaga , then went into decline along with the fall of the muromachi bakufu after the onin war .
** jisha-bugyo and special bugyo were set up in the local administrative organs such as rokuhara tandai , oshu shogunfu and kamakura government .
** suden worked full-time on the affairs of temples and shrines alone after katsushige itakura ' s death .
suden died in 0000 , during the reign of shogun iemitsu , therefore , subsequently no one was in charge of the affairs of temples and shrines .
therefore , a post to deal with litigation related to temples , shrines and local provinces far from the capital was established in 0000 .
at first , this post was under the direct control of shogun , then the roju system ( member of shogun ' s council of elders ) was established and the roju controlled the post .
however , it came under the direct control of the shogun again in 0000 during the reign of shogun ietsuna .
** in principle , fudai daimyo ( daimyo as hereditary vassal to the tokugawa family ) with more than 00 , 000 koku were appointed to jisha-bugyo , simultaneously serving as sojaban ( officials in charge of ceremonies ) .
[it was an exception that tadasuke ooka , who was hatamoto ( direct retainer of the shogun ) , achieved the rank of daimyo and became edo machi-bugyo ( town magistrate of edo ) without serving as a sojaban . ]
among the three magistrates ( jisha-bugyo , kanjo-bugyo , machi-bugyo ) , jisha-bugyo was the top-ranked , because kanjo-bugyo and machi-bugyo were under the control of roju .
the fixed number of places was about four , and their offices were in their residences .
they worked on a monthly rotating schedule .
** being a member of hyojosho ( conference chamber ) as well as kanjo-bugyo and machi-bugyo , jisha-bugyo was in charge of litigation regarding not only temples and shrines , but also many territories , except for kanhasshu ( the eight provinces of the kanto region ) .
the main task was to control temples , shrines and their priests .
in addition , the jisha-bugyo controlled temple town citizens , people in the domains of temples and shrines , folk religious leaders such as ascetic buddhist monks and philosophers , and artists such as poets .
as temples and shrines controlled the family registration of common people at that time , the role of jisha-bugyo , which managed litigation and family registration , was similar to the present ministry of justice .
** in period dramas , tharey are often scenes where doshin ( police constable ) and yoriki ( police sergeant ) of the machi-bugyo are annoyed at a criminal who has escaped into the grounds of a temple or shrine , because these territories were under the control of jisha-bugyo .
but this is not based on fact .
hitsuke tozoku aratame-kata ( literally , " investigative division for arson and organized robbery ) could investigate or capture the criminals within the domain of a temple oｒ a shrine without jisha-bugyo ' s prior approval .
when a temple or a shrine protected a criminal , jisha-bugyo investigated it strictly and sometimes took the priests into custody .
therefore , a temple or a shrine was not immune from the law .
** kamakura kubo
** history
** kamakura kubo in chronological order
** the position was also referred to as the kanto kubo .
** kamakura kubo is categorically a historical term which a kamakura kubo used to call himself but was not used in general during that period .
the one holding the post was generally referred to as " kamakura gonsho " or " kamakura dono . "
rather than being an official government position designated by the shogun , a kamakura kubo was no more than substitute position while the shogun was absent from kamakura .
** as kamakura kubo , motouji controlled ten provinces in the kanto region ( later controlling mutsu province and dewa province as well ) along with the kantokanryo ( estate officer of kanto）as his assistant , but with each generation conflict became more serious with the bakufu in kyoto .
when the eikyo war broke out , the kamakura kubo entered into conflict with the kantokanryo as well , and after losing the battle in 0000 , the fourth kamakura kubo mochiuji ashikaga was defeated and ordered to commit suicide leading to the post being temporarily discontinued .
in 0000 , the post was restored when mochiuji ' s son nariuji ashikaga was allowed to take the post of kamakura kubo by the bakufu .
nariuji later came into conflict with the bakufu , and in 0000 moved his headquarters to koga country in shimousa province and called himself the ' koga kubo ' ( kyotoku war ) .

** kebiishi ( police and judicial chief )
** summary
** government inner service
** kebiishi was a ryoge no kan post ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
the meaning of the post was to ' do justice . '
kebiishi was a government official within the kebiishicho ( office of police and judicial chief ) .
the tang name for the suke ( assistant ) and jo ( military officer ) was eni ( fourth rank of the kyukei ( nine government posts of the han dynasty ) ) .
kebiishi were in charge of maintaining security and handling civil affairs in kyoto .
for security purposes , the post was also placed in ryoseikoku ( provinces ) in the late heian period .
** in the late heian period , ' cho-rei ' ( a common law called a historical custom of the kebiishicho ) , different from the ritsuryo code , was applied in order to exercise the authority of the kebiishi in criminal cases .
around that time , clerical work for the kebiishicho were taken care of at the residence of betto ( superintendent ) .
at the end of the heian period , kebiishi were replaced by imperial palace guards for the north side , who were a militant organization of insei ( ruled by the retired emperor ) .
furthermore , when the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) established the rokuhara tandai ( an administrative and judicial agency in rokuhara , kyoto ) , kebiishi were gradually weakened .
** during the muromachi period , the bakufu was placed in kyoto and authority became held by the samuraidokoro ( board of retainers ) .
** betto
a betto was equivalent to the kami ( director ) of the shitokan ( four classifications of bureaucrats ' ranks ) .
kebiishi no betto ( superintendent of the imperial police ) held the highest authority of the kebiishi but was not personally a kebiishi .
suke
** a suke of the government inner service was a post equivalent to the assistant director ( also called suke ) of the shitokan .
there were only two posts of suke which were served by the uemon gon no suke ( provisional assistant captain of the right division of outer palace guards ) and saemon no gon no suke ( provisional assistant captain of the left division of outer palace guards ) .
suke were essentially the person in charge at a kebiishicho since betto were often combined with other governments posts .
** daijo ( senior lieutenant )
a daijo was equivalent to a jo ( inspector ; third highest of the four administrative ranks of the ritsuryo period ; also known as hogan ) of the shitokan .
the number of daijo posts was limited to four .
uemon no daijo ( senior lieutenant of right division of outer palace guards ) and saemon no daijo ( senior lieutenant at the left division of outer palace guards ) held the position of daijo as a second post .
the position of daijo became a hereditary post for the sakanoue and nakahara clans as myohoka ( teacher of law ) .
** shojo ( junior lieutenant )
a shojo was equivalent to a jo of the shitokan .
there was no limit to the number of shojo posts .
emon no jo ( third ranked officers of outer palace guards ) were double posted as shojo .
from the late 00th century , the minamoto clan and the taira clan often held this post .
minamoto no yoshitsune was called kuro-hogan because he had this responsibility .
** daishi and shoshi ( senior assistant lieutenants )
this post was equivalent to the sakan ( secretary ) of the shitokan .
there was no limit to the number officers who could old this post and many young myohoka assumed the post .
** kadonoosa
kadonoosa was responsible for controlling the prison , locking up criminals , and later responsible for capturing criminals .
kadonoosa performed their duty in an atypical outfit consisting of a red kariginu ( robe ) , a white frock , and held a white walking stick .
** anju ( officer who recorded and stored documents at a shoen ; manor )
anju was a clerical officer of the kebiishicho which was initially limited to one post but was later increased .
** kacho
kacho were selected from the eshi ( guards ) of emonfu ( headquarters of the outer palace guards ) .
kadonoosa and anju were then selected among the kacho .
** homen
homen was a former criminal , also referred to as a shimobe , whose sins had been forgiven and worked for the kebiishicho .
homen were in fact put in charge of searching for criminals and responsible for their capture and torture .
** remarks
there was a player character from an early computer game called " heiankyo " that was modeled after kebiishi .
** gonkan
** the term " gonkan " means official court posts that were created beyond the prefixed number of personnel .
it means ' supernumerary officials . '
such posts were often created in the heian period .
incidentally , ingaikan ( supernumerary officials ) were appointed in the nara period .
** many court nobles were appointed to gonkan in the heian period and the posts of gonkan were always occupied by someone .
the following situation existed behind the above .
at that time , there was a custom where family heads or sons of prestigious families , including the fujiwara family , were automatically given official ranks , regardless of their ability , when they reached a certain age .
on the other hand , the number of government posts was predetermined .
under these conditions , there was a need to create gonkan in order to give them posts .
** a nominal title of gonkan was sometimes used in order to demote one ' s political rival , such as the case of sugawara no michizane .
he lost his position through a conspiracy perpetuated by the fujiwara clan and was appointed to ' gon no sochi ' ( provisional governor-general ) of dazaifu ( local government office in kyushu region ) , the gonkan of dazai no sochi ( the head of dazaifu ) .
though the post itself was a high-rank , he was actually banished to kyushu where dazaifu was located .
** after the northern and southern courts period , according to " kanshoku konan " written by tomokiyo takada , only gonkan existed , instead of regular ones , in the case of dainagon and chunagon ( vice-council of state ) .
examples
** gon dainagon
gon chunagon ( provisional vice-council of state )
gon no kami ( provisional provincial governor )
gon no kokushi ( provisional provincial governor )
gon no hyoe ( provisional vice-minister of imperial guard division )
gon no sojo ( provisional lower priest in the highest position )
** unrelated examples
gonsuke : kitchen workers of merchant ' s family
or one of official posts in the meiji era .
it is equivalent to soninkan ( the posts to which persons are appointed by the emperor based on the recommendation of the prime minister )
** genji choja
** summary
** " genji choja " means the head of the minamoto clan .
in principle , a person who had the highest court rank among the persons of minamoto clan became genji choja .
in the minamoto clan , genji choja had various authorities relating to religious service , summons , litigations and recommendation of promotion .
it is generally believed that genji choja concurrently assumed the position of the betto ( superintendent ) of both shogakuin ( a private school of the ariwara family ) and junnain ( a family school named for the summer palace of emperor junna ) .
however , chikafusa kitabatake , who was genji choja , explained in his book " shokugensho " that being the shogakuin betto satisfied the requirement to become genji choja ( in this case , the deputy becomes the junnain betto ) .
** originally , genji choja came from the saga-genji ( minamoto clan ) .
the first genji choja is believed to have been sadaijin ( minister of the left ) minamoto no makoto ( court noble ) .
in other words , there is a possibility that genji choja was not identical with the betto of both shogakuin and junnain .
later , imperial prince shigeaki and minamoto no takaaki ( daigo-genji ) , whose maternal grandfather was a person of saga-genji , were appointed to genji choja .
since then , persons of daigo-genji typified by minamoto no takaaki and those of uda-genji typified by minamoto no masanobu were appointed to this position alternately .
** in 0000 , michimoto koga was appointed to genji choja for the first time .
** yoshimitsu ashikaga of seiwa-genji became genji chaja for the first time as buke-genji ( minamoto clan as samurai families ) .
the ashikaga shogunal family and the tokugawa shogunal family starting from ieyasu tokugawa became genji choja while being samurai family ( they insisted that they were the descendants of the nitta family of seiwa-genji ) .
actually , ashikaga family of seiwa-genji and koga family of murakami-genji served as genji choja alternately ( the former ' s tenure was longer than that of the latter ) .
in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , persons from the koga family of murakami-genji were appointed to genji choja .
the tokugawa family monopolized the position of genji choja beginning with ieyasu tokugawa .
provided that tomohiko okano presumes that tatemichi koga once became genji choja at the time of disorder in the end of edo period .
** genji choja was merely the highest title among minamoto clans after the collapse of the ritsuryo system .
however , the above theory is not accepted commonly .

** a post of the orthodox church
** a term " shitsuji " generally means a person who oversees a clerical job , and in the case of prestigious families or temples/shrines , it means a person who presides over household affairs or administration .
the japanese word " shitsuji " corresponds to various job titles overseas .
** in english , for example , it corresponds to butler , chamberlain , archdeacon and deacon etc . , and the latter two are job titles used in christianity .
its meaning differs depending on contexts .
** it corresponds to the title of employee in europe and the us .
although there are similar job titles in many countries , butler in the uk is well-known among others .
in japan , shitsuji was introduced by the peerage and wealthy families since the meiji period , and they wielded great power as the head of employees .
at present , shitsuji exists only in royal families and considerably wealthy families .
** male shitsuji who is the head employee is often called ' ji ' ( literally , old man ) in fictional stories .
** dai-betto ( director general ) under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized governmemt under ritsuryo code ) ( the head of directors ) .

an important post for mandokoro ( the office of administration ) of the kamakura bakufu , which originated from the above .
** this post was inherited by the persons of the nikaido clan and these persons often concurrently served as " rei " , the second-highest post of mandokoro .
** shogunal deputy during the early stages of the muromachi bakufu .
moronao ko is well-known .
this post came to be called kanrei since the era of yoriyuki hosokawa .
** the head of monchujo ( the office of inquiry ) or mandokoro of the muromachi bakufu .
** persons of hino line or kanjuji line , which were powerful among various lines of fujiwara clan , were appointed to this post and engaged in the management of sekkan-ke ' s territory etc .
** this post was called either in no shitsushi or shitsushi-betto and was the head of in no betto ( administrator of the retired emperor ' s office ) .
since that time , ministers or court nobles became customarily appointed to this post .
even after the insei ( government by cloistered emperors ) declined , this post continued to exist until the end of the edo period .
** the post of shitsuji was set at mandokoro and monchujo of the kamakura bakufu .
after the establishment of the muromachi bakufu , moronao ko of ko clan , which had served as kasai ( main retainer ) of ashikaga clan for generations , became responsible for the household management of ashikaga shogunal family and was called shitsuji .
however , since the structure of the bakufu itself had an aspect of the household management organ of shogunal family , he came to be involved in important political matters like onsho ( reward grants ) and shomusata ( trial dealing with land-related issues ) .
after moronao ko was killed in a war , persons of the ashikaga clan , such as those of the niki clan and the hosokawa clan , were appointed to shitsuji .
the title of kanrei came to be in use when kiyouji hosokawa was appointed to shitsuji .
when takatsune shiba suceeded the position , he called himself ' kanrei , ' gave the title of ' shitsuji ' to his eldest son yoshimasa shiba and jointly administered the affairs of state .
needless to say , takatsune , who was a father and kanrei , held a real power and yoshimasa , who was shitsuji , was merely an assistant .
in 0000 when yoriyuki hosokawa became the adviser/guardian of newly-inaugurated shogun yoshimitsu ashikaga according the will of yoshiakira ashikaga , he seized full power of bakufu as kanrei .
since then , the title of this post became ' kanrei ' while shitsuji fell into disuse .
** at the same time , the head of mandokoro and monchujo , the body of bakufu , came to be called ' shitsuji . '
while monchujo gradually became a mere façade , shitsuji of mandokoro effectually became the hereditary post of the ise clan , which achieved a remarkable result in fiscal reconstruction in the late 00th century .
** after noriaki uesugi returned to the post of kanto-shitsuji , his son toshinori uesugi succeeded this post and it became the hereditary post of the uesugi clan .
since then , this post came to be called kanto-kanrei modeled after the central government .
at that time , noritomo uesugi and yoshikane shibukawa were ordered to support masatomo and were appointed to the post of kanto-shitsuji .
however , yoshikane became upset with the kanto-kanrei uesugi clan because he killed noritomo uesugi with the aim of depriving the uesugi clan of its power .
as a result , masatomo and yoshikane were refused to enter kamakura and masatomo was forced to call himself horikoshi-kubo in izu province .
after yoshikane lost his position because of this incident , masanori uesgi , the eldest son of noritomo uesugi , succeeded the position and made efforts to reconcile with kanto-kanrei .
however , he later came to odds with masatomo and was ordered to kill himself .
thereafter , no successor was appointed and the post of kanto-shitsuji was abolished when horikoshi-kubo was destroyed by moritoki ise ( soun hojo ) .
** in the process of the reformation , jean calvin created shitsuji as a church post , and the anglican church also set this as a post .
** at the anglican church , shitsuji means a clergyman who supports a priest .
** at gerontocracy churches ( e . g . the reformed church , the presbyterian church ) , shitsuji means a post assumed by ordinary believers that is responsible for accounting and welfare matters .
** at congregational churches , shitsuji means ordinary believers who serve the church ( god and church members ) .
( a pastor is included in shitsuji in a broad sense since he is deemed to be a believer , too )
** an executive of the orthodox church of christianity
** josai ( deacon ) of the catholic church and hosai ( deacon ) of the orthodox church are also deemed to be a post having the same origin as the above .
although the word ' shitsuji ' is used as a japanese translation for the title of a position in both the episcopalian anglican church and the reformed church/ the presbyterian church , the positions themselves are completely different .
in the case of the congregational churches , all executives are called shitsuji except for some specialists .
** shitsuji of the anglican church is similar to the josai of the catholic church .
this post is granted by a bishop through ordination .
shitsuji is not allowed to preside over the eucharist .
provided , however , that shitsuji is allowed to preside bunsan （distribution of the emblems in communion） when allowed by a bishop .
although shitsuji ' s clothes were used for a church service similar to those of bishops , shitsuji can be distinguished by stola which he put obliquely on his left shoulder .
** shitsuji of the presbyterian church is one of four posts advocated by calvin ( pastor , instructor of theology , dean and shitsuji ) .
shitsuji is in charge of church accounting , preparation of the eucharist and distribution jobs such as mutual-aid and welfare .
this is a post that is assumed by ordinary believers , not by the clergy .
according to the theory of the reformation , this post is not a newly created one , but was restored based on the bible because the original one at the original church had been distorted by the roman catholic clergy system .
** based on the principle of universal priesthood , executive position is regarded as a role , not a post .
therefore , all people who serve the church , including those who are called superintendents or deans in other sects , are called shitsuji .
at most churches , shitsuji is appointed through the election by its members and serve his/her tenure .
** at the orthodox church , a post called diakonosu in greek is currently called hosai ( deacon ) .
believers other than the clergy who are engaged in the management of church are called ' shitsuji . '
as shitsuji of the anglican church corresponds to hosai of the orthodox church while church executives in other sects correspond to shitsuji of the orthodox church , caution is required when using a term ' shitsuji . '
** oryoshi
** summary
** " oryoshi " was a ryoge no kan ( official posts outside of the ritsuryo code ) under the japanese ritsuryo system ( ancient centralized government system based on the ritsuryo code ) .
it was an official post in charge of police/military affairs .
** oryoshi first appeared in a document in 000 as a person who commanded sakimori ( soldiers garrisoned at strategic places in kyushu ) to move .
at that time , oryoshi commanded soldiers but did not engaged in actual battles .
before long , however , oryoshi ' s job gradually changed to be that of a battle director who commanded soldiers .
** in principle , the post of oryoshi was concurrently assumed by kokushi ( provincial governor ) or gunji ( localｌ magistrate ) who excelled in military art .
oryoshi was mainly engaged in the maintenance of security in a province such as the current local police .
in some cases , oryoshi was responsible for the security in a district instead of a province .
further , there were cases where oryoshi was in charge of military affairs in a wide region like tokai-do road/tosan-do road .
** at any rate , as oryoshi ' s job was based locally , local powerful families were mainly appointed to this post and their private military power made up the main force of oryoshi .
fujiwara no hidesato , who defeated taira no masakado as the oryoshi of shimotsuke province , is well-known .
it is believed that oryoshi also existed at shoen ( manor ) and was engaged in the maintenance of security in shoen .
** kurodo no to ( the name of a post )
** handling imperial papers and conveying statements to emperor , " kurodo no to " played a role that functioned something like a secretary to emperor .
ordinarily , a person in shii ( the fourth rank ) was appointed to " kurodo no to " but was provided with no official court rank .
two people were appointed to the post of kurodo no to .
** as for the order of seats in the imperial court , the kurodo no to occupied the top seats , higher even than the higher ranking tenjobito ( high-ranking courtiers ) .
for this reason , he was also called kanzu ( a leader ) .
in addition , use of kinjiki ( literally , " forbidden colors , " seven colors traditionally reserved for the imperial family and nobility ) was permitted for him .
** in 000 when kurododokoro was established , fujiwara no fuyutsugu and kose no notari were appointed to the first " kurodo no to " posts .
corresponding to fuyutsugu ' s success in his carrier , " kurodo no to " came to be assigned to sangi ( councilor ) immediately when the sangi post became available .
therefore , the post of kurodo no to could be said to be a stepping stone to promotion to the court nobility .
** of the two " kurodo no to " posts , one was assigned mostly to a person at the " konoe no chujo " post , a post for military officers , and another to a person at the benkan post , a post for civil officers .
therefore , the term of " tonochujo " was used to refer to the former personnel and " tonoben " for the latter personnel .
however , exceptions did occur during the heian period .
for example , when the kura no kami ( head of the bureau of palace storehouses ) jointly assumed the post of kurodo no to , he was known as the toto ( head-head ) .
it was towards the end of the heian period that the practice of assigning a " tonochujo " and a " tonoben " to " kurodo no to " was established .
** mandokoro
** mandokoro of the imperial family and court nobles
** theory on ' mandokoro politics '
** mandokoro of kamakura bakufu
** organization
** mandokoro in the muromachi period
** organization
** mandokoro was an administrative board for domestic economy that was allowed to be set up by imperial princes , princesses and court nobles ranked sanmi ( third rank ) or higher .
mandokoro was opened in the heian period .
** it was one component of the office organization system within the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
** it was one component of the office organization system within the muromachi bakufu as well .
** mandokorocha is a kind of tea leaf that is gathered at the tea plantation in the eigenji area of higashiomi city , shiga prefecture .
the tea is so famous that there is a song written about it that sings , ' uji is the center of production and tea is the production of mandokoro . '
** mandokoro is an administrative board in charge of the domestic economy of japan run by the imperial family and court nobles ranked jusanmi ( junior third rank ) or higher .
officers of the board were called keishi ( household superintendent ) .
** ( in addition , during the heian period it was common among the aristocracy to have marriages where a man married into his wife ' s family which meant the residence was handed down from the family to the wife ) .
** with the establishment of the shoen ( private estate ) system , the mandokoro became the institute in charge of estate management affairs .
in the middle ages when shoen declined , however , the domestic economy run by the court nobles stagnated and the essence of the mandokoro was gradually lost .
** mandokoro was a governing institution that was part of the kamakura bakufu .
it had been formerly known as the kumonjo ( administration office ) organization .
this change was brought about by minamoto no yoritomo who opened up the bakufu to acquire the right to establish mandokoro , which until then had only been open to court nobles ranked jusanmi ( junior third rank ) or higher .
this event had such significance that his own governing system took on a formal attribute based on the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
mandokoro took charge of general political affairs and finance in the kamakura bakufu .
** there are various theories about the moment in which the name was changed from kumonjo to mandokoro .
** mandokoro betto : director of the mandokoro administrative board
the first betto was oe no hiromoto
later on , the shikken ( shogunal regent ) or rensho ( assistant to regents ) would double as the betto .
** rei : deputy director of mandokoro
the first person to take the post of rei was yukimasa nikaido ( later he and hiromoto became the betto ) .

** yoryudo : a clerk in charge of miscellaneous chores .
at first it was also called ' mandokoro kujin ' ( public clerk of mandokoro )
** position in charge of the financial administration and lawsuits related to territory affairs in muromachi bakufu .
** shitsuji ( chief of the mandokoro , the administrative board ) - became a hereditary post of the ise clan after 0000 , except for a short time to celebrate the genpuku ( coming of age ) of yoshimasa ashikaga where tadayuki nikaido filled the post .
** mandokoro shitsuji : chief of mandokoro , the administrative board ) .
the sasaki clan , nikaido clan and kyogoku clan were appointed to the post , but later the ise clan handed it down as a hereditary post .
** mandokoro shitsujidai : deputy steward of the office of administration
the saito clan and the matsuda clan took turns for the post .
** mandokorodai : proxy officer of mandokoro administrative board

** kosho
** summary
** male homosexual partners
** famous figures who were once kosho
** kosho （小姓） is the name of a post in a samurai family similar to a page or squire .
it is also commonly written as 小性 which literally means " small sex . "
** as they grew up , many kosho demonstrated brilliant performances as a close retainers to their lords .
hideyoshi toyotomi and ieyasu tokugawa took sons from daimyo lords as hostages under the pretext of taking them on as kosho .
** although the primary duty of a kosho was to guard their lord , the main duties of a kosho were to serve closely to their lord , doing daily chores and arranging visits by acting as a go-between delivering messages .
** as kosho were always stationed close to their lord , konando-yaku ( a job to do chores ) was created for them to act as a foot page .
** many domain lords appointed excellent , young clansmen who had just celebrated their genpuku ( attainment of manhood ) to such positions as kosho or goyonin with the intention of fostering human resources to work as their hands and feet in the future .
** the son of a senior vassal was sometimes appointed to be a companion or close associate ( sobashu ) to the son of a lord as a live-in kosho .
** in order to act as bodyguard and be trusted with important state matters , kosho were put in the closest physical position to their lord , with some domains prohibiting them from having contact with other families , including their own .
** sons in the same situation who were the descendents of a daimyo lord , however , were given a paid rank ( or paid position ) and seldom became nakakosho .
** alternatively , in order to reduce mouths to feed and give their sons an education , second and third-born sons of an impoverished samurai family were often sold to a buddhist temple where they worked as ' tera-kosho ' and took care of the personal needs of buddhist monks .
** ( however , this duty was not necessarily a common responsibility for kosho . )
although this practice continued into the edo period , as genroku culture came to its end during the middle of the edo period , the practice of male homosexuality drastically declined .
** individuals in which there are letters of evidence
shingen takeda and masanobu kosaka ( in this case , however , there is evidence that the family name kasuga ( kosaka ) was added to the document at a later time ) .

** shokan
** formation
** becoming samurai
** shokan was the general name of an officer governing japanese shoen ( manor ) entrusted by the lord of the manor .
** ( these farmers were called ' kaihotsu ryoshu ' [reclaimers] ) .
however , the legal basis of their property rights was fragile and it was possible for kokuga ( provincial government offices ) to seize the properties .
thus , tatos donated their land to the powerful nobles or powerful temples in the central government in order to be exempt from charges and to keep the power of their land .
shokan is a general name including gesu and kumon .
generally , shokan received land from a part of the manor .
the land that shokan received was exempt from charges and shokan could keep all of the harvest .
geshi/gesu ( lower ranked officer ) were named , distinct from the lord of the manor , as joshi ( geshi ' s superior ) , and the name of kumon was derived from their role , which was management of books and records .
** ryoke often donated their manors to the imperial or sekkan families and the lord of the manor at the top of the relationship was called honke ( head family ) .
the person who controlled the manor among the honke and ryoke was honjo ( proprietor or guarantor of the manor ) .
to take greater control of manors , honjo often sent down their retainers to supervise gesu and kumon .
the retainers who were sent down to local manors were called azukaridokoro/azukasso ( deputy of the ' shoen ' manor lord ) .
azukaridokoro was also one of the shokan .
later , some kaihatsu ryoshu ( including gesu and kumon ) were appointed as azukaridokoro .
** as there was no clear legal rule , control and management of manors were not stable and depended on the authority of the lord of the manor .
therefore , conflicts over the control , management and boundaries of the manors often occurred between other shokans and kokuga ( provincial government offices ) , and the shokans handled these problems .
some shokans became samurai .
( not all shokan became samurai . )
** in the kamakura era , some shokan were admitted as gokenin ( an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the kamakura era） or jito ( manager and lord of the manor ) by kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
this meant that the protection by the lord of the manor was not enough and shokan began to rely on the kamakura bakufu which rose as a new authority .
shokan began to disrespect the lord of the manor ( honjo ) and rob honjo of their interests .
from the beginning of the muromachi era , shokan transformed into kokujin ( local samurai ) as local lords .
even so , shokan had existed with the manorial system until the sengoku period , however , they disappeared because manors were dissolved by taiko-kenchi ( the land survey of hideyoshi toyotomi ) .
but some words such as " shoya " ( village headman ) and " myoshu/nanusi " ( village headman ) remained in the edo era as the remnants of shokan .
** jundaijin ( a government post )
** jundaijin was a government post in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
this post was a ryoge-no-kan position ( an official position outside of the ritsuryo system ) that was positioned under the nadaijin ( minister of the interior ) and above the dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) .
** the person in this post was usually called gido-sanshi ( read the following ) .
in the middle of the heian period , fujiwara no korechika was demoted to dazai no sochi ( governor-general of the dazai-fu offices ) from naidaijin , but was permitted to attend chogi ( ceremony at imperial court ) again .
however , as there were no ministerial posts available at that time , his seat at the imperial court was located under the ministers but above the dainagon , as ordained by an imperial order in 0000 .
in 0000 , his post was made equivalent to the ministers and he was presented with 0 , 000 households ( whose taxes served as his income ) .
he then called himself gido-sanshi .
later , use of this post as " ryoge no kan " was established , and the jundaijin post was introduced .
** in japan , its original meaning of " the formal rank in rites is equal to that of the three ministers " was restored .
this indicated that the post was equivalent to sanko ( three high level bureaucrats ) , or daijo-daijin ( grand minister of state ) , and minister of the left and minister of the right .
therefore , after mototomo horikawa ( 0000 - 0000 ) was appointed to the post in the kamakura period , ' gido-sanshi ' was established as the chinese version name of jundaijin .
** this was a government post given to the tosho-ke ( the hereditary lineage of court nobles occupying relatively high ranks ) whose uppermost rank available was determined to be dainagon , such as the urin family and some important noble families .
in the edo period , this post was coveted by tosho-ke .
the post was often given to a person loved by the emperor or a maternal relative to the emperor .
it was customary that , when a person was to be appointed to the post , juichii ( junior first rank ) was given to the person prior to the actual proclamation of the appointment .
** kindachi
** later , the children of the taira family also came to be called kindachi .
** kengyo
** kengyo ( one of the officers governing shoen manor ) is the highest title of official rank for blind officers during the middle and early modern ages .
** the term kengyo originally referred to the manager who administered office duties in temples or shoen ( private estates ) during the heian and kamakura periods , but from the muromachi period onwards , it was established as the highest title for blind officers .
** kengyo were allowed to wear special clothes with a hood and carry a walking stick .
among the mokan ( blind officers ) , there were betto ( superiors of a temple ) , koto ( the third title of official rank within the todo-za - the traditional guild of the blind ) , and zato ( the fourth title ) in order of rank .
** origin
as the son of emperor ninmyo , imperial prince saneyasu became blind while he was still young and entered the priesthood to live a cloistered life in yamashina ( present day yamashina ward , kyoto city ) .
as he entered the priesthood , imperial prince saneyasu gathered the blind to teach them to play the biwa ( japanese lute ) , wind and string instruments and to recite poems .
after the death of the prince , the two blind retainers who had served at his side were each given the titles kengyo and koto .
it is claimed that this is the origin of the blind officer named kengyo .
a stone called biwaishi ( japanese lute stone ) , on which imperial prince saneyasu allegedly sat and played the biwa , was enshrined in moroha shinto shrine by the blind as a guardian for biwa hoshi ( biwa players ) .
the term ' hoshi ' ( biwa players in monk attire ) derives not only from kengyo shaving his head and wearing officially designated kengyo clothing that was similar to monk attire , but also because a number of hoshi did in fact join the priesthood .
** muromachi period
** edo period
during the edo period , the bakufu encouraged the blind to join the todo-za , consolidating the organization which started to enjoy considerable autonomy even though it was under the jurisdiction of the jisha-bugyo ( magistrate of temples and shrines ) .
there were 00 ranks between admittance to toda-za and the rank of kengyo , with the rank of kengyo being divided further into ten sub-ranks from ichi-ro ( 0st senior ) to ju-ro ( 00th senior ) .
aside from clerical work , all accounting jobs at todo-za were carried about by persons with visual and hearing disabilities , and it was revealed that their memory and calculation skills were so precise that not even the slightest inaccuracy could be found .
later in the edo period , however , heikyoku , which had been the exemplary accomplishment of todo-za , had lost its popularity , and jiuta sangen , sokyoku and acupuncture became the practical skills required to become a kengyo professional instead .
not all members of the todo-za were talented in music and acupuncture however , and there were some who changed their profession or entered into the financial business as mentioned below .
it is estimated that to become kengyo by being promoted through each sequential rank from lowest to highest , it costed a total of 000 ryo ( unit of gold currency ) .
in edo , the blind officers of todo-za , including kengyo , were sometimes collectively referred to as ' zato . '
** there were some kengyo who were employed by daimyo ( feudal lord ) as in-house musicians with a stipend equivalent to an annual crop volume large enough to support several people , such as kengyo yatsuhashi in the iwakitaira domain and kengyo yoshizawa in the owari domain .
furthermore , there were also kengyo who were successful as acupuncture doctors and others who became famous as scholars .
** on the other hand , to facilitate the income of gold and silver needed to quickly acquire official ranks , the bakufu permitted them to be money lenders with high interest rates during the genroku era .
in 0000 , eight kengyo and two koto were banished from edo after forfeiting all of their assets for their excessively underhanded means of making profits .

** uchitsuomi
** summary
** uchitsuomi ( naishin ) was one of ryoge no kan ( official posts outside of ritsuryo code ) which existed from the asuka period to heian period under the government based on the ritsuryo code .
four persons were appointed to this post in history and all of them came from the fujiwara clan .
** being the chief adviser to the emperor , uchitsuomi presided over important state affairs while assisting the emperor , and it was an important post comparable to ministers .
however , this post was not a permanent one and its role also varied according to time and circumstances .
** nakatomi no kamatari ( fujiwara no kamatari ) was appointed to this post for the first time in history after the head family of the soga clan fell in isshi coup ( the murder of the year of isshi ) which occurred in 000 .
he assisted the emperor tenchi as a pivotal figure in politics who led all government officials and implemented the taika reforms .
under this situation , the extraordinary post of ' uchitsuomi ' was created so that kamatari could take part in the center of government .
on the day before his death , kamatari was granted taishokkan ( grand crown ) and was appointed to ' naidaijin ' ( minister of the center ) .
** the second person who was appointed to this post was fujiwara no fusamae , a grandson of kamatari and the founder of the northern house of the fujiwara clan .
under the situation where four fujiwara families and imperial families like nagayao and so on were at odds , it is said that he was appointed with the aim of paving the way for the enthronement of imperial prince .
being sangi ( councilor ) , fusamae ' s status was not so high at daijokan ( grand council of state ) .
in addition , he was in a position to check daijokan when necessary since he was in charge of jutoneriryo ( the office of imperial guards ) .
** rather , it is considered that they were in a position as an advisor to the government who had independent authority from that of the daijokan .
it is also controversial whether fusamae was removed from uchitsuomi when imperial prince ascended the throne on the grounds that the purpose was achieved or whether he continued to be in office until his death .
** the third person who was appointed to this post was fujiwara no yoshitsugu of the ceremonial house of the fujiwara clan , a great-grandson of kamatari and a nephew of fusamae .
when sadaijin fujiwara no nagate died of disease in 000 , yoshitsugu , being the pivotal figure of the fujiwara clan , was put into a position to support the emperor konin .
as a result , he was promoted slowly and was chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) at the time .
in order to reward yoshitsugu ' s service , uchitsuomi was upgraded six years later to naidaijin modeled after the case of kamatari , and formally became the ministerial post as a ryoge no kan .
** the last person was fujiwara no uona , a close aide of the emperor konin and the fifth son of fusamae .
he was appointed in 000 after naidaijin yoshitsugu died in the previous year .
although uona was dainagon at the time , it is considered that his political footing was the same as that of yoshitsugu since onakatomi no kiyomaro remained in the same position .
although the title of this post was renamed ' chushin ' within one month after uona ' s appointment , uona was appointed to naidaijin in the following year .
** shibichudai
** summary
** staff
** it was a ryoge no kan ( an organization outside of the ritsuryo code ) .
** the agency originally called kogogushiki ( the empress household agency ) or kotaogogushiki ( the empress dowager household agency ) was renamed according to the tang-style name of shibichudai .
though it was a household agency , it held the authority to implement the order ( ryoji ( orders issued by princes , empresses and so on ) ) of the empress dowager komyo as well as exercise military power .
it became the de facto supreme authority and military arm of the nation according to nakamaro ' s expansion of power .
its status was equivalent to daijokan ( council of state ) and its head called shibirei was treated equal to that of dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) .
it is believed that shibinaisho played an equivalent role to that of uchitsuomi ( a important governmental post presiding over important state affairs while assisting the emperor ) .
when tang-style names were adopted for government organizations in 000 , it was renamed kongukan and defined as the organization to ' receive the imperial orders and convey them to government officials . '
as a result , shibinaisho was put into a position to convey and implement the order of the retired emperor koken and the emperor junnin in place of daijokan and became the organization comparable to daijokan both in name and reality .
nakamaro served as its head from the very beginning , but the post of shibinaisho became vacant when nakamaro was appointed to oho ( udaijin ( minister of the right ) and became the top of the daijokan in 000 .
since then , its significance faded gradually though it was still under nakamaro ' s charge , and was abolished when the empress dowager komyo died in 000 .
however , according to shoso-in monjo ( shoso-in archives ) , kongukan ( shibichudai ) was involved in a sutra-copying project conducted on the first anniversary of the empress dowager ' s death .
judging from the above facts , it is believed that it was actually abolished around 000 .
** after having overthrown nakamaro , the empress shotoku ( formerly , the empress koken ) established nijusho ( ministry of royal pages ) , a military organization modeled after shibichudai , as a permanent ryoge no kan .
** shibirei ( director general of shibichudai ) ( corresponds to shosanmi ( senior third grade ) ) : renamed shibinaisho ( from 000 ) .

** kageyushi
** summary
** official posts
** kageyushi was a ryoge no kan ( official posts outside of the ritsuryo code ) under the japanese ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
it was created during the early heian period for the purpose of inspecting local administration .
later , the inspections extended to include the naikan ( offices locate in kyoto ) .
kageyushicho , the office of kageyushi , was located on the north-west side of daijokan ( council of state ) and to the south of chumusho ( ministry of central affairs ) .
its japanese name was ' tokuruyoshikangafuruno tsukasa . '
** in the nara period ( late eighth century ) , the post of kokushi became a source for additional gains , such as kugaito ( local source of revenue ) .
under this situation , there were cases where disputes concerning additional profits would occur between a predecessor and a successor and the handing over of a job was not carried out smoothly .
** the emperor kanmu , who ascended the throne during the end of the eighth century , started to reconstruct slackened local administration in order to extend the imperial power throughout the nation .
as a result , kageyushi was created as a post to take charge of the inspection and supervision of local administration .
** kageyushi ' s duty was to inspect geyujo which was brought back by a predecessor .
by doing so , the government intended to reduce disputes associated with the change of kokushi and improve the quality of kokushi ' s administration .
** it is believed that kageyushi was created in 000 .
kageyushi was once abolished in 000 , and instead kansatsushi , whose duty was to inspect local administration on gokishichido ( five provinces and seven circuits ) basis , was created .
however , the inspection job of geyujo was succeeded by the left and right benkankyoku ( controllers ' office ) .
** before long , however , kageyushi was recreated in 000 because the number of disputes associated with the change of kokushi was on the increase .
later , officials of naikan were also obliged to prepare geyujo when they changed , and such geyujo was added to the target of kageyushi ' s inspection .
also , when the handing over of a job was not carried out successfully , a predecessor and a successor were obliged to prepare fuyo-geyujo in which the reason thereof and the arguments of both parties were described .
** thus , kageyushi became an important post which was in charge of the inspection and supervision of both central and local administration .
its duty included dispute settlement when fuyo-geyujo was submitted as well as compiling kotaishiki , a code concerning the change of officials .
kageyushi ' s inspection was called kanpan at the time , and its record ( kageyushi-kanpanjo ) was compiled in " seiji yoryaku " ( examples of the politics in the heian period ) , a reference book for politics .
** one theory asserts that the significance of kageyushi gradually waned in the middle to late heian period because official posts increasingly became ' family business , ' in other words , a certain post was exclusively inherited by a member of specific family .
it is considered that kageyushi continued to play a role in inspection until the end of the heian period when zuryo was active .
** kami ( minister ) ( corresponded to shogoinoge ( senior fifth rank , lower grade ) ) : one person , high-ranking officials , such as sangi ( councillor ) or benkan ( controller ) , were often appointed to this post .

** tsuibushi ( pursuit and apprehension agent )
** summary
** tsuibushi ( pursuit and apprehension agent ) was a ryoge no kan ( a japanese government post which was not established by the ritsuryo codes ) .
the post was in charge of police and military affairs .
at first it was a temporary post , but later became a permanent post of the nation under the ritsuryo system .
** tsuibushi was set up for the first time in 000 , in order to clean up pirates and barbarians who often haunted nankaido ( southern sea region ) .
the term " tsuibu " meaning ' pursuing and apprehending ' in japanese , tsuibushi did not originally have a military role , but often fought in actual battles in order to get pirates or rebellions under control .
** ono no yoshifuru is famous as tsuibushi , who subdued fujiwara no sumitomo ' s war in the johei and tengyo war .
** after tsuibushi was permanently established in each province , kokushi ( provincial governor ) concurrently served as tsuibushi , or gozoku ( local ruling family ) was appointed to be tsuibushi in many cases .
at the end of the 00th century , a government post named sotsuibushi was established take charge of police and military affairs , and took over the functions of tsuibushi .
then , minamoto no yoritomo was appointed to be nihonkoku-sotsuibushi ( literally , sotsuibushi of japan ) in 0000 and the appointing power of sotsuibushi was transferred to kamakura-dono ( lord of kamakura ) , and the post of sotsuibushi gradually evolved into shugo ( military governor ) .
** kansatsushi ( inspector )
** japan
** yi dynasty
** kansatsushi refers to a government post which was established in tang dynasty china , in yi dynasty korea , and in japan in the early heian period , for the purpose of inspecting the local administration .
this was ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) which was not regulated in the ritsuryo codes for both tang and japan .
during the yi dynasty , it was an institution under the direct control of the king .
** tang
** in the period of genso ( tang ) , do ( administrative district ) of which the number had been 00 was increased to 00 , and saihoshochishi ( auditor ) were placed in each do .
saihoshochishi was later changed to kansatsushochishi ( abbreviated as kansatsushi ) by changing its name .
kansatsushi was a nominal post for inspection , but , effectively held authority on the inside of do .
many kansatsushi who concurrently assumed the post of setsudoshi ( military governor ) established around the same time also controlled the administration and military , and held a lot of power .
** for details , refer to the article of ' hanchin . '
** in japan , in around 000 in the initial heian period , emperor kanmu aiming at the thorough performance of local administration established kageyushi ( board of discharge examiners ) which audited the administrative performance by chihokan ( a local official ) ( kokushi ( provincial governor ) ) .
kageyushi strictly audited the administration by kokushi , and attained some progress in improving the local administration .
** however , when emperor kanmu died in 000 , emperor heizei , the successor , advocated innovating politics , and in june of the same year , he abolished kageyushi as part of this innovation , and newly established kansatsushi .
at first , kansatsushi was established in each of rokudo ( six districts ) ( tokaido , hokurikudo , sanindo , sanyodo , nankaido and saikaido ) excluding tosando , and was also called rokudokansatsushi .
it was decided that the post of kansatsushi should be concurrently assumed by sangi ( councillor ) , one of the members of giseikan ( legislature ) .
kansatsushi was an important post on par with sangi .
** in the next year , 000 , kansatsushi was also established in tosando and kinai region ( the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of nara and kyoto ) .
in addition , sangi was abolished , and only kansatsushi remained .
** under circumstances where a relation between emperor heizei who abdicated from the throne in the previous year , 000 , and emperor saga was aggravated in 000 , emperor saga issued the imperial edict to abolish kansatsushi and bringing back sangi in july of the same year .
as a result of this , the four-year history of kansatsushi ended .

** kurodo refers to one of ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo codes ) in japan .
the kurodo played the role of secretary .
kurodo was called jichu , sekiro or sekihairo in tang china .
kurododokoro ( the chamberlain ' s office ) was a place to perform clerical work , and was established in the northern part of kyoshoden hall ( palace archives ) in the imperial palace .
蔵人 , chinese characters of kurodo , also refers to one of hyakkan na ( a name taken after his or her family ' s official rank ) or person ' s name , and in this case , it was pronounced as ' kurando . '
** in 000 , emperor heizei assigned his throne to emperor saga , and moved to heijo-kyo ( the ancient capital of japan in current nara ) as the retired emperor heizei .
therefore , emperor saga who were in heian-kyo without a secretary had a problem in documentation and clerical work .
this was the start of the history of the kurodo .
such appointments were conducted also for the purpose of preventing secrets from being leaked to the side of the retired emperor heizei .
thereafter , the authority was strengthened during the periods of emperors koko and uda , and the organization was expanded .
** as a domestic governing institution of the imperial family , kurododokoro was originally in charge of management of documents and gyobutsu ( imperial treasures ) , handling of confidential documents , and handling of suits .

** gundai
** gundai （a magistrate of a region or an administrator of a town ) is the name of a post set in the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and in clan domains from the muromachi period to the edo period .
the post was also referred to as koribugyo ( magistrate of a country ) .
** muromachi period
gundai or koribugyo was generally used to refer to a daikan ( local governor ) who controlled a unit of gun ( country ) under the direction of a shugodai , but there were also times when these terms were also used to refer to a shugodai .
a person with this position had one or two countries under their jurisdiction .
** edo period
during the edo period , gundai was a post set within the bakufu as well as in each domain .
** within the bakufu , the post referred to a local governor ( daikan ) who controlled a relatively wide extension of government territory .
early on during the edo period , aside from the kanto region , a gundai post was set in almost all of the provinces , including kamigata , amagasaki , mikawa , tanba and kawachi .
after the middle edo period , the number of gundai was reduced to four : kanto gundai , mino gundai , saigokusuji gundai ( kyushu region ) and hida gundai .
the status and rank of a gundai was higher than that of a daikan , but the scope of the work between the two was nearly the same .
in the early edo period , the post called koridaikan ( local governor of a country ) was set up under control of the roju and had nearly all the same duties , but was abolished in 0000 .
** a gundai or koribugyo was set up in each domain in order to administer government in directly controlled clan territories .

** bugyo of today
** bugyo is the name of a profession for a samurai family from the heian period to the edo period .
a person with this title was also called a bugyonin ( magistrate ) and the office in which the duties were carried out was called bugyosho .
** originally , it was a verb that meant ' to duly execute the respectful order of one ' s superior , ' and the infinitive form was ' bugyo-suru ' ( to do bugyo ) .
the word later became used to refer to a person in charge of something .
** in the heian period , the first reference to bugyo appeared in a document referring to a provisional position to carry out public events and court functions .
after the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) was established , bugyo was designated as an official duty in charge of domestic bakufu economies , shugo ( provincial constables ) and kokujin ( local samurai ) .
during the edo period , not only in the bakufu , but also in territories controlled by daimyo ( japanese feudal lord ) , and from the middle of the period , strong governing systems with the characteristics of a bureaucracy called han ( or domain ) were formed .
many people employed by the bakufu and daimyo families had the position of bugyo with various ranks , from senior executive to lower executive .
** descriptions of the position of bugyo and examples in which the post was set up according to time period
** a role provisionally set up to carry out ceremonies and rituals in the imperial court .
** the name of permanent and temporary positions specifically in charge of government practices in the kamakura bakufu .
** examples : chinzei bugyo ( a magistrate of the kyushu region ) , shugo ( provincial constable ) * later became shugo daimyo ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable )
** the name of permanent and temporary positions specifically in charge of government practices in the muromachi bakufu .

ongoku-bugyo ( the collective name of the magistrates placed at important areas directly controlled by the government during the edo period )
** in present-day japan , it is used as the name for a role used in a rite or festival held at a shrine in which local residents and their children participate in the ritual .
when someone is essentially in charge of preparing nabe ( a japanese dish served in a hot pot ) , which is cooked with the participation of everyone at the table , they are commonly referred to as " nabe-bugyo . "
** kyoto fuchishu ( 京都扶持衆 )
** it is also called kyoto onfuchishu ( 京都御扶持衆 ) .
** in the muromachi period , the kanto region was ruled by kamakura kubo , who was the representative of the seii taishogun and acted in the role as head of the kamakura-fu .
the kanto region was put under the indirect rule of the bakufu .
the kamakura kubo was gradually confronting the bakufu and finally came to desire the shogun post .
to put a stop to these actions by kamakura kubo , the bakufu formed master-subordinate relationships directly with influential samurai warriors who were opposed to kamakura kubo in the kanto and ou area .
** these samurai warriors were called kyoto fuchishu ( according to the records of the time , kyoto onfuchishu . )
although they were samurai warriors from a province under the jurisdiction of the kamakura bakufu , they were not obliged to go and serve the kamakura-fu and were put under the direct direction/control of the shogun , and were not directed by the kamakura kubo .
the bakufu formed the kyoto fuchishu and proceeded with anti-kamakura kubo activities .
it is believed that there were more than a dozen kyoto fuchishu samurai families during the reign of shogun yoshimochi ashikaga .
the muromachi bakufu superficially criticized the activities of the fuchishu , whilst at the same time actually providing mental and material support .
** moｒeover , though yoshimochi issued the order of subjugation , yoshimochi implicitly approved these acts in order to weaken mochiuji ' s influential power .
when mochiuji learnt this , he killed mitsushige oguri to scare the kyoto fuchushu ( war of mitsushige oguri ) .
yoshimochi aggressively suggested it as being a ' personal war ' , which led to asking sankanrei ( three deputies ) , tokihiro yamana and mitsusuke akamatsu about whether the killing mochiuji would be right or wrong .
finally , the disturbance was cleared up with mochiuji`s apology .
** however , while the bakufu was trying to prevent mochiuji from strengthening his influential power using the warrior kyoto fuchishu as an intermediary , mochiuji was attempting to put them down , and such continued confrontations became a cause that lead to eikyo no ran ( eikyo war ) .
after the fall of kamakura kubo in the eikyo war , the yamanouchi-uesugi family , kanrei of kanto , who were sympathizers of the bakufu , seized power to control kanto , so it is believed that the warrior kanto fuchishu disappeared naturally .

** kiden hakase ( professor of history )
** kiden hakase refers to a post established in daigaku-ryo ( bureau of education under the ritsuryo system ) in the early heian period and taught kidendo ( the study of the histories ) , but , was integrated into monjo hakase ( professor of literature ) later .
the rank was equivalent to shoshichiinoge ( senior seventh rank , lower grade ) .
** on march 0 , 000 , the post of kiden hakase was established by appointing one person from myogyo chokko ( teacher of myogyodo ( the study of confucian classics ) ) ( another group of myogyo hakase ( professor of confucian classics ) ) .
conventionally , the history was under the jurisdiction of monjo hakase , and some part was under the jurisdiction of by myogyo hakase .

** tono chujo ( a government post )
** summary
** tono chujo in the tale of genji
** tono chujo is the name of a government post in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) in japan .
** two people were appointed to the post of kurodo no to .
fourth-ranking officials and bukan ( military officers ) from the konoefu ( headquarters of the inner palace guards ) were often appointed to the post of tono chujo also .
** in " kantobisho " ( a book written by fujiwara no toshinori ) , it is written that tono chujo did the work of ' kinchu banji ' ( everything in the imperial palace ) and to no ben did that of ' tenkakosai ' ( everything ) .
it is also written in the book that tono chujo was in charge of services in the imperial palace and to no ben was in charge of communications about government affairs between the emperor and daijokan ( grand council of state ) .
** the main duty of tono chujo was to wait on the emperor .
** tono chujo was also the name of a character in ' the tale of genj . '
in addition to being hikaru genji ' s old friend and brother-in-law , this person was also his rival in politics and in love .
however , here tono chujo is used like a proper noun .
in the main text of ' the tale of genji ' this person was always known by the different positions he held as his career and age advanced .
he didn ' t keep the same name throughout the story .
during the ' yugao ' chapter ( the tale of genji ) , the chapter in which he becomes a central character , he holds the position of tono chujo , so this is how he was known by later readers .
after that he advances to the positions of gon chunagon ( provisional middle counselor ) , udaisho ( ( major captain of the right division of inner palace guards ) and nadaijin ( minister of the interior ) before finally becoming a dajodaijin ( grand minister ) .
in his final days after retirement he was known as ' chiji no otodo ' ( retired minister ) .
he appears in the chapters from hahakigi to minori .
** the setting
the fujiwara clan
he was the legitimate son of emperor kiritsubo ' s sadaijin ( minister of the left ) .
his mother , omiya , was the younger sister of emperor kiritsubo ( in the tale of genji ) and the mother of aoi no ue ( it is often said that he is her older brother but the age gap is unknown ) .
he was a tall , handsome and showy individual .
he also excelled at literature and music .
he was known as an virtuoso of the koto ( japanese harp ) , better even than genji .
in his youth , he was a young nobleman ranked with genji , and often competed with genji for the same woman .
he doted on yugari , the daughter of genji and the deceased aoi no ue ( his nephew in other words ) , who was like a son to him until their relationship deteriorated over the kumoi no kari incident .
he has more than ten children ( four of whom were daughters ) .
** character
in the otome chapter , he is described as having a distinct and magnificent character and also of being thoughtful , passionate about learning and well-versed in government affairs .
when genji suffered misfortune and retired to suma to seek seclusion from the world , tono chujo was the only person to visit him , without fear of attracting disapproval from the powers-that-be .
for better of worse he was depicted as having a clear , manly character .
for example , in anger he blocked the love between his daughter kumoi no kari and yugiri .
** however , there is a clear distinction between the times in the story when he is depicted favorably and those when he isn ' t .
for this reason , some researchers have complained that his character is inconsistent and not worth analyzing .
furthermore , his rank is always one rank below that of genji ' s and he always lags behind genji in disputes .
in other words , many people think that genji just uses him for his own ends .
( for example , even though he the real father or the deceased yugao ' s daughter , tamakazura , it is genji that actually acts as her guardian ) .
** his wife and children
his legal wife was yon no kimi , the minister of the right of emperor kiritsubo ( she was also the younger sister of kokiden no nyogo ( emperor kokiden ) and the elder sister of oborozukiyo ) .
their children were called kashiwagi , kobai and kokiden no nyogo .
their estrangement while still young was deplored by his father and father-in-law .
however , i the prime of his life he and yon no kimi are depicted looking after the sick and bedridden kashiwagi together .
** his concubines were known to be the mother of kumoi no kari ( of royal descent ) and yugao ( the daughter of sanmi no chujo and the mother of tamakazura ) .
however , the mother of kumoi no kari later divorced him and married azechino dainagon ( at which time kumoi no kari came under the care of her grandmother omiya ) .
yugao disappeared after being threatened by his legal wife .
also , he seems for a time to have taken pity on a lower class woman who went on to give birth to omi no kimi .

** uji no shaku
** since the conferment of jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) was called joshaku ( conferring a peerage ) , this was called uji no shaku as an annual promotion conducted to each clan .
its other name was uji no kyo .
** in the first place , the authority of uji no choja was on a declining trend in the heian period , and possessing influence on personnel affairs for the said clans under the system of uji no shaku resulted in restrengthening the authority of uji no choja .
** eishaku ( an honorable position or rank )
** an eishaku indicates an honorable position or rank .
it was also another name for jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) during ancient and medieval japan .
furthermore , it was also used as a term to express a special privilege given to temples , shrines or guji ( chief priests ) .
later , it was also used to indicate other high ranks .
** eishaku : special privileges of temples , shrines or guji ( chief priests )
each year a temple , shrine or guji could grant the rank of jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) to one person who desired the rank and who had paid a joryo ( a fee to obtain the rank ) .
this system began in the early heian period .
it was a system for selling ranks , the same as nenshaku in which a rank was granted of paying joryo to a retired emperor , empress or sannomiya ( third prince ) .
advancement through eishaku was quite common from the end of the heian period to the kamakura period .
** the amount an applicant had to pay for eishaku was called eishaku-ryo or joshaku-ryo .
** kamonryo ( bureau of housekeeping )
** history and official duties
** officials
** kamonryo refers to ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) belonging to kunaisho ( ministry of the sovereign ' s household ) under the ritsuryo system in ritsuryo japan .
according to " wamyo ruijusho " ( dictionary of japanese names ) , this was also called kanimori no tsukasa .
** kamonryo was in charge of setup when court functions were held , and cleaning the inside of the palace .
therefore , some of its official duties overlapped with those of tonomo-ryo ( bureau of grounds ) which managed and maintained facilities in the imperial court .
kamori ( housekeeping ) of tomo no miyatsuko ( servant of the court administering a group ) was attached , and was in charge of cleaning and setup .
00 persons of kushicho ( general workers ) who were assigned to government officials requiring a large number of persons were assigned , and conducted practical works .

** ashigaru taisho ( general in command of a troop of foot soldiers )
** an ashigaru taisho was a commanding officer who lead ashigaru troops ( foot soldiers ) under a daimyo ( japanese territorial lord ) during japan ' s sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
they were also called ashigarugashira .
during the edo period , they were also referred to as monogashira .
** until the muromachi period , ashigaru had served as a type of military engineer .
after the onin war , as officers and soldiers in battles wore only light armor , ashigaru came to have an active role as a main battle force .
during the sengoku period , battles became more organized and complex on a large scale and the role of ashigaru became increasingly important due to their mobility .
ashigaru troops in particular , who were trained with spears , bows and guns , were organized and became active as a main fighting force .
retainers of daimyo who were appointed to the position of ashigaru taisho made great achievements leading ashigaru troops .
they were ranked immediately below the daimyo as sodaisho ( commander in chief ) and samurai daisho ( commander of warriors ) and lead soldiers including ashigaru kogashira ( also called ashigaru kumigashira ) ( foot soldier captains ) who were their own subordinates .
** due to their achievements , the position of ashigaru taisho gradually rose , and in the late sengoku period they were provided with an annual stipend of 000 to 000 koku , and regarded as the middle-class warriors .
** sodaisho ( a commander in chief )
** sodaisho was a commander in chief who lead an army composed of more than one corps .
in particular , the term " sodaisho " was often used to differentiate the highest ranking official from other generals in an army composed of more than one corps .
sodaisho were also referred to as sotaisho , shusho or sosui .
** summary
** sodaisho is a concept used to refer to a busho ( military commander ) who lead an entire army within the battle history from the heian to the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
** on the other hand , in the case of troops being organized by allied samurai groups , each group had an independent chain of command and the sodaisho was just a figurehead with relatively weak authority .
** kurodo no betto ( chief of the chamberlain ' s office )
** kurodo no betto was a post of ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) that was equivalent to a kami ( chief ) of the kurododokoro ( chamberlain ' s office ) .
** the post was limited to one person at a time .
as the role of a kurodo no betto was to supervise the tenjobito ( a high-ranking courtier allowed into the imperial palace ) , it was also referred to as ' tenjo no betto . '
the official duty of this post was to deliver shochoku ( imperial edict ) to each ministry .
although a daijin ( cabinet minister ) and second-rank personnel were generally appointed to kurodo no betto as a second post , because it was ryoge no kan the post did not have a corresponding official rank .
** during the early heian period in 000 , the kugyo ( top court official ) fujiwara no tokihira was the first to be appointed to this post , but in later years it became a concurrent post for the sadaijin ( minister of the left ) .
when the sadaijin served as kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) , however , the udaijin ( minister of the right ) became the kurodo no betto .
** goi no kurodo ( chamberlain of fifth rank )
** goi no kurodo was a post of ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) under the japanese ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
this post was equivalent to a suke ( assistant director ) at the kurododokoro ( chamberlain ' s office ) and was placed immediately under the kurodo no to ( head chamberlain ) .
** the first two persons to be appointed as goi no kurodo were named minamoto no tatsu and fujiwara no toshiyuki , after which the term appeared frequently .
the post of goi no kurodo had existed beforehand as well , but there was also the post of mui no kurodo ( chamberlain with no rank ) , meaning that the official ranks for eight positions of kurodo were not always standardized .
during that time , it was difficult to classify every official as a kurodo because there was a clear distinction between the fifth and sixth ranks in terms of social status , as well as considerable differences between their social activities and custom rituals .
as official duties of the kurododokoro were gradually specialized , social status became closely related to who was posted where .
it is believed that this lead to the establishment of the goi no kurodo post and the reason behind the improvements to the corresponding organizational infrastructure .
** rokui no kurodo ( a government post )
** rokui no kurodo was a ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) post for officers at kurododokoro ( the chamberlain ' s office ) .
this rank was placed immediately under goi no kurodo .
up to four to six persons were appointed to this post .
the people performed secretarial roles , such as waiting on the emperor .
this post was also called higero .
sixth-rank personnel were appointed to this post .
however , persons at his post became tenjobito , who were permitted to enter the imperial court , and were also allowed to wear kikujin no ho ( loose-legged pleated trousers used for formal wear in kikujin color ) .
therefore , the post was considered an honorable one because persons assigned under his post closely attended the emperor .
** no age limit was applied to the post .
however , seating was arranged in the following order , corresponding to the order of appointment : shin-kurudo , uji-kurodo , sashitsugi and gokuro .
** when a person had spent six years in the position of gokuro , they were automatically promoted to the fifth rank .
in these cases , if there were no goi no kurudo ( fifth rank kurodo ) positions available , the person retired from his kurudo post and became a jigenin ( lower ranking court official ) .
such people were named kurodo no goi ( fifth rank kurodo ) .
however , if this person did not want to leave his position as a tenjobito to become a jigenin , he turned down the new rank , remained at the sixth rank and took a shin kurodo position once more .
this practice was known as gyakutai .
** therefore , persons at the rokui no kurod post had to to either follow the ' gyakutai ' practice or become a jigenin .
in later eras , no person experiencing rokui no kurodo reached the court noble level .
in early-modern times , the persons at this post , who were tenjobito but did not belong to tosho-ke , were consistently considered those belonging to upper classes among jigenin .
descriptions of these people were recorded in the jigekaden ( a record of jige ( lower ranking court officials ) genealogies , written by kageumi mikami ) .
** in early-modern times , people in this post were permitted by the emperor to use kinjiki ( seven colors traditionally reserved for the imperial family and nobility ) , and even jigenin could use kane ( oxidized liquid ) to blacken their teeth , just like the tosho-ke .
the use of kinjiki was disallowed if someone became a jigenin , but they could continue to use kane throughout their lives .
** shunshi
** from the heian period , " shunshi " was the title given to monjosho ( students of literary studies at imperial universities ) .
** summary
** shunshi was the title given to monjosho who were students at daigaku-ryo ( bureau of education under the ritsuryo system ) .
during the early heian period when monjosho was limited to children from privileged families , shunshi was established as a title given to the five monjosho students with the highest scholastic standing .
shunshi later began to be made up of students other than those from privileged families , and as chances to become monjosho were extended to students who were not from privileged families , the title of shunshi fell into disuse .
near the end of the heian period , there were a number of cases where shunshi were called myogyomonjasho ( a student who is a master of myogyo - chinese classics of confucianism ) .

** senke jissoku
** house of sen and shokka
** fixing of shokka
** list of senke jissoku
** since the artisans able to make the tea utensils in the taste of the house of sen were limited , and as they played certain roles in events and buddhist anniversary services , the shokukata ( artisan ) gradually came to be fixed .
although the number of shokukata fluctuated depending on the successive iemoto ( the head family of a school ) , it was organized into the current jissoku during the meiji period .
( there is also a theory that jissoku was named by mitsukoshi department store in the taisho period . )
** since sado is usually performed in a small space called chashitsu ( tea room ) using unique manners , the tools used there have to be creative .
sen no rikyu , especially , selected his tea utensils with a unique taste , such as a tea bowl by chojiro ( the first-generation kichizaemon raku ) and a kettle by yojiro tsuji , kyogamashi ( kyogama kettle maker ) .
sen no sotan , who attempted to hand down the style of tea ceremony by sen no rikyu , trained artisans and preferentially treated those who were able to make works which were in line with rikyu ' s taste .
** it is said that kichizaemon and sotetsu , especially , were like doyens among the shokukata of the time .
** it is also said that there were over 00 shokka which did not make visits the house of sen but presented tools to the house .
** on the other hand , since senke jissoku played certain roles in annual events of san senke and buddhist anniversary services , in addition to the production of tea utensils which incorporated traditional forms , the shokukata who paid visits gradually came to be fixed .
sotetsu nakamura is the only member not mentioned above ; it is considered that this was due to the family being in mourning for the sixth-generation sotetsu nakamura at the time .

** sanboku-isso
** " sanboku-isso " was the name given to the four meritorious retainers who received the emperor godaigo ' s favor under the kemmu restoration .
their names were masashige kusunoki , chikamitsu yuki , nagatoshi nawa and tadaaki chikusa , and the title of sanboku-isso came from all of their names collectively .
** the characters used for masashige ' s family name were " 楠木 " ( camphor tree ) which are read as " kusuno-ki . "
the characters for chikamitsu ' s family name were " 結城 " and are read as " yu-ki . "
nagatoshi was nicknamed " ho-ki " being that he was from hoki province .
** common points of the four sanboku-isso :
under the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) system , they would not have succeeded due to their origins .
** all four rose to high ranks by winning the " emperor ' s favor . "
** their periods of prosperity were extremely short .
( all four lost their lives during the kenmu era in the battle with ashikaga clan in 0000 ) .
** losing the lives of the four sanboku-isso military commanders at an early stage in the battle between the southern and northern dynasties led to an extreme military disadvantage for the southern dynasty .
** tamori ( field administrator )
** history
** tamori was a position in charge of managing fields on public lands , which was set up by the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
for most of the tamori positions , peasants who had expertise in techniques were selected .
** although provincial constables or manor lords gave instruction in farming before the muromachi period , a position of professional instructor of farming techniques was set up for the first time in the muromachi period .
the edo period saw a significant improvement of farming techniques thanks to the tamori .
** the origin of tamori is supposedly tanbomori , a service provided in the hokuriku region in the late kamakura period .
the tanbomori was in charge of daily observations of paddy fields and their vicinity , to mainly study rice blast fungus .
each year the families in the village took their turn to be in charge of tanbomori .
later this position called tanbomori was handed down among certain families for many generations .
the family name , tamori , that remains in the hokuriku region is a remnant of families of professional tanbomori .
** in the muromachi period , occupations were further specialized , and the tanbomori became a profession called the tamori .
before that , specific families succeeded the tanbomori by word of mouth for some generations .
after the onin war , the bakufu set up the profession of tamori across the country to restore the farming villages destroyed in the war .
at first the tamori only gave instruction within the area of public lands , but later came to instruct the neighboring farming villages .
in the late muromachi period , local samurai assigned the tamori independently .
** in the late sengoku period ( period of warring states in japan ) , many peasants in farming villages were sent off to war , and this resulted in a critical decrease in agricultural production .
therefore , daimyo ( japanese territorial lords ) in the sengoku period across the country treated good tamori well to attract them to their territories , and tried to prevent them from moving away to other territories .
this led to the extinction of tamori as an occupation except for a few influential tamori .
** as society gradually became more stable in the edo period , the tamori profession was revived around the country .
especially in the hokuriku region , a rice-producing region , clans employed a number of tamori to protect their paddies from being damaged by cold weather and focus on stabilization of rice cultivation .
in this period , many books on agricultural techniques , such as ' noka eki ( farming handbook ) ' and ' nogyo zensho ( compendia of agricultural knowledge ) , ' were published and the techniques that had been handed down by the tamori were recorded systematically .
incidentally , some of the tamori used their wealth of knowledge about plants and worked as herbalists .
** later in the meiji period , due to the industrialization policy of the government , many tamori gave up their businesses .
** shoen-ryoshu ( lord of a manor )
** summary
** " shoen-ryoshu " was a lord that governed a shoen ( manor ) .
the word shoen-ryoshu was a commonly used term to indicate the honke ( patron ) and the ryoke ( proprietor ) , the highest classes that governed shoen .
although the term shoen-ryoshu is used in historical science in contrast to the term ' zaichi-ryoshu ' ( resident landholder ) who were owners of vast properties of land , this term was not actually used during that time period .
** as a result , there were many cases of shoen that were the property of big temples and shrines which were able to endure even into the latter half of the medieval period .
** yomei no suke ( a sinecure post as honorary deputy governor )
** summary
** yomei no suke in " the tale of genji "
** yomei no suke is a vice minister of kokushi ( provincial governors ) , an honorary post without official duties and benefits .
it indicates a person in a government post .
** therefore , a person was occasionally appointed to a government post in an honorary capacity under this system .
people in these honorary posts were called ' yomeikan ' as they had no power and were officials in name only .
later , as the government ' s financial position worsened , a person was occasionally appointed as vice governor of provincial offices ( suke ) in an honorary capacity .
the resulting honorary post of suke was called the yomei no suke .
" godansho " ( the oe conversations , with anecdotes and gossip ) describes typical examples of honorary posts including yamashiro no suke ( assistant governor of yamashiro ) and suieki kan ( head of the waterway station ) .
it can be said that buke-kani ( official court titles for samurai ) in the edo period were also merely honorary titles .
** however , there is a different hypothesis that yomei no suke originally had a different meaning .
meanwhile , kozuke , kazusa , and hitachi provinces were shinno ninkoku ( provinces whose gubernatorial posts were reserved as sinecures for imperial princes ) , where suke acted on behalf of the vice governor of the province .
** however , when the system of nenkan and nenshaku became common and the suke as yomeikan was created , the meanings of yomeikan and yomei no suke became confused .
as a result , the yomei no suke , which was originally a high-ranking office , came to be regarded as a purely honorary role .
incidentally , sadachika nakayama described in his book " sakkai-ki " the following historical event when asked by the retired emperor gokomatsu to look for the precedents of yomei no suke :
** the term ' yomei no suke ' appears only once in " the tale of genji " in the volume ' yugao ' as : ' a house of a yomei no suke . '
** it seemed that even koreyuki sesonji in the insei period ( the period of government by a retired emperor ) could not interpret the original meaning of ' yomei no suke . '
accordingly , in " genji shaku " ( commentaries of the tale of genji ) an incorrect explanation was added that ' yomei no suke is suke appointed in the country , who was from the minamoto clan . '
** seishinko-ki ( diary )
july 00 , 000 .
yomei kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor only in name ) is a person nearing retirement .
i think that yomei should not be limited to suke of the country .
thus in the seishinko diary the yomei are called the yomei kanpaku .
they were also referred to as yomei jo or yomei sakan .
** sanshi ( a government post )
** sanshi is a government post in charge of calculation in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
it was established in the kazueryo ( account office ) , the shuzeiryo ( bureau of taxation ) , dazai-fu ( local government office in kyushu ) and later in the shurishiki ( office of palace affairs ) and mokuryo ( bureau of carpentry ) .
** two sanshi were appointed to both the kazueryo and shuzeiryo , and their equivalent rank was juhachinoge ( junior eighth rank , lower grade ) .
each person at the post calculated the tax coming into the capital and the amount spent .
their ranks were equivalent to juhachinoge and in 000 they were given permission to carry a shaku ( wooden mace ) .
** one person was appointed to the daizafu ( become 0 people from 000 onwards ) and their rank was equivalent to juhachinoge .
this person ' s totaled-up the taxes for the entire kyushu area and in 000 he it became mandatory for this person to bring the tax accounts to the capital and report them .
** a sanshi post was established in the shurikishi in 000 , then in the mokuryo ( the exact year of the latter is unknown , but it was before the compilation of the engishiki ( an ancient book of codes and procedures ) ) .
one person was appointed to each of the posts , and their treatments , including their rank , were set to the same as those at kazueryo and shuzeiryo .
** in addition , a sanshi post was sometimes placed also in each of the fields of finance , civil engineering and construction as ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) .
in the early nara period , a sanshi post was placed in the construction ministry that was established for the construction of heijo-kyo capital .
a sanshi post was sometimes provided to determine boundaries among handen ( allotted farmlands ) , koden ( fields administered directly by a ruler ) and shoen ( manors ) or to design buildings , gardens , etc .
** two san hakase ( doctor of numbers ) were responsible for training the sanshi at the daigakuryo ( bureau of education ) .
00 students ( known as sansho ) took classes using the kyushosanjutsu and the shuhisankei ( chinese mathematics books ) as textbooks , and a prescribed number of students who passed the test were appointed to sanshi posts .
however , it is likely that the necessity of advanced mathematics was not recognized keenly in japan at that time , and it is said that what was learned was only basic pragmatical arithmetic and no advanced mathematics were involved .
** otomoshu
** a few of the main otomoshu
** " otomoshu " were a group of busho ( military commander ) attendants who proceeded to the ancient capital of kyoto from kamakura and devoted themselves to raising shogun takauji ashikaga ' s army .
descendants of the busho who served as attendants in this group succeeded the title of otomoshu .
** otomoshu within the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government head by a shogun ) .
rather than being an official post in the muromachi bakufu , the term was used to indicate class standing .
furthermore , otomoshu also differentiated from the family status of daimyo or shugo ( japanese territorial lord ) .

** bugyoshu ( group of magistrates )
** history
** the early stage of the muromachi bakufu
** the yoshinori era
** for further interest
** bugyoshu , also called yuhitsukata , were of group of bugyonin ( magistrates ) who were lawyers of the bureaucracy within the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
as a group of civil officers with direct control of the bakufu , they were correspondents to the hokoshu ( guard force with direct control of the bakufu ) , a group of military officers .
** bugyonin had already existed within the kamakura bakufu , and upon its collapse , a number of them followed takauji ashikaga and joined the muromachi bakufu to be employed as bugyonin .
** as a consequence of these developments , the duties of bugyonin began changing as well .
** hikitsuke were effectively made obsolete and yuhitsu ( amanuensis , secretary ) were stationed at places such as the mandokoro ( administrative board ) , the samuraidokoro ( board of retainers ) , monchujo ( board of inquiry ) and onshokata ( department that handled reward duties ) .
** a number of bugyonin were appointed to a post in charge of special assignments and were referred to as ' betsu-bugyo ' ( extra bugyo ) .
** influential figures among the yuhitsu were called gozenbugyonin ( also gozenshu , gozensatashu and onshokatashu ) and were allowed to participate in gozensata ( shogunal hearings ) that were presided over by the seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) .
** under such circumstances , their opinions at gozensata meetings began to have a serious influence on the shogun ' s decisions and they gradually established themselves as private consultants of the shogun .
** of particular note was the highest-ranking gozenbugyonin , referred to as kuninbugyo , who together with having control of the yuhitsu and bugyonin became a member of the hyojoshu .
following suit were several high-ranking gozenbugyo who also received treatment equal to that of the hikitsukeshu ( naidanshu ) .
in spite of the importance of their role , they could only be promoted up to kaigo ( deputy chief of the office ) or shitsujidai ( deputy steward ) , which were equivalent to an assistant director of an organization within the formal structure of the bakufu .
in addition , bugyonin ( gozensatashu ) , who were no higher than gozenbugyonin , were collectively called gozenmisanshu .
** it is believed that one of these individuals was tsunehisa iio ( hikoroku saemon no jo ) , who served the hosokawa clan shugo ( governor ) of awa province and composed a poem depicting kyoto in burnt ruins after the onin war .
** under these circumstances , a clash occurred between the bugyoshu and hokoshu in 0000 .
** entering the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) when yoshitane ashikaga and yoshizumi ashikaga both stood as shogun , the bugyoshu divided as well and mutually existed in both bakufu structures .
it believed that it was in this manner that the bugyoshu continued to exist as an entity that supported the administrative structure of the muromachi bakufu until its collapse .
** naidanshu ( judges )
** summary
** naidanshu were in charge of judging trials dealing with land-related issues in hikitsukekata or naidankata ( both are offices of adjudication ) of the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
it was also called the hikitsukeshu as it was a successor to the system of hikitsukeshu set up by the kamakura bakufu .
** naidan originally meant meetings in the departments held within the various sections of the muromachi bakufu .
additionally , jinseigata ( a court in muromachi bakufu ) and teichugata ( office of direct petition ) were also set up for the purpose of retrial , instruction and supervision .
** many of them were descendants of hyojoshu ( a member of the council of state ) , hikitsukeshu , and bugyonin ( a magistrate ) of the kamakura bakufu , and some served concurrently as hyojoshu or bugyonin in the muromachi bakufu .
in deliberations , the oldest bugyonin ( magistrate ) participated , or kaigo ( post ) , second to the tonin ( vice minister and executive officer ) explained the case and then council members stated their opinions in the order decided by drawing lots .
decisions were documented and officially took effect with final decisions made by a shogun .
** accordingly , the hikitsukekata became a mere façade and were no longer appointed from the early fifteenth century .
** this does not mean the revival of hikitsukekata councils .
** daijokan chuke
** the daijokan chuke essentially indicated the kitchen that belonged to the daijokan ( grand council of state ) , but in ancient times the term referred to the government officials who administered the daijokan kitchen .
** the primary duties of the daijokan chuke were to provide any equipment or novelties needed in order to prepare food served at conferences and events in the daijokan .
** following this example , officers were assigned one at a time as an azukari ( deputy ) of shisho ( official in charge of miscellaneous documents ) at the shonagon and benkan bureaus .
the duty was part of a shift system with a term of one year each , ending every year in february at the rekken ceremony ( an annual ritual during the heian and nara periods in which officers were evaluated for promotions ) .
** koden jishi ( land taxes ) were delivered to the daijokan chuke in the form of shomai ( rice that has been pounded in a mortar ) and keika ( 軽貨 ) along with reishinnomotsu ( 例進納物 ) from various provinces .
as a result , a variety of shoen ( manor ) called a ben no ho was established in place of the joden .
in addition , remaining joden and ben no ho effectively became territory of the ozuki clan who passed their service as kanmu ( also known as sadaishi which was the senior recorder of the left ) from one generation to the next .
** ichinokami ( the ranking council member )
** ichinokami was the head of the kugyo ( top court officials ) and usually referred to the minister of the left .
** the ichinokami was the highest-ranking minister among the kugyo , except for daijo-daijin ( grand minister of state ) , who received direct instructions from the emperor , and sessho kanpaku ( regent and chief adviser to the emperor ) , who acted for the emperor .
otherwise , naidaijin ( minister ) was appointed as ichinokami ; and very occasionally the dainagon ( major counselor ) was appointed as ichinokami .
in addition , ichinokami were in charge of kurodo ( chamberlains ) other than the head chamberlain , as they served concurrently as kurodo-betto ( superintendent of chamberlains ) , as well as onmyo-ryo betto ( superintendent of the bureau of divination ) .
** this was done because fujiwara no michinaga was worried that akimitsu and naidaijin fujiwara no kinsue were too old to serve as ichinokami .
in 0000 , fujiwara no yorinaga became ichinokami due to the vacancies of ministers of the right and the left , and attempted to restore government affairs , thus taking over power from his brother fujiwara no tadamichi .
** shomyo ( lesser daimyo )
** shomyo were samurai who were not well known .
shomyo paired up with daimyo ( feudal lord ) .
** explanation
shomyo means a samurai family which was not ranked as high as daimyo .
attention is necessary when using the term shomyo , as its meaning varies depending on the period or situation .
the term shomyo itself appeared as early as the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) and referred to vassals who controlled a castle , or daimyo with a low stipend .
** accordingly , daimyo with a stipend of under 00 , 000 koku or jinya daimyo were sometimes referred to as shomyo .
** additionally , vassals with a stipend of not less than 0 , 000 koku were sometimes referred to as shomyo .
** myoho hakase ( professor of law )
** myoho hakase was an official post affiliated with the daigaku-ryo ( bureau of education ) under the ancient japanese ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
the post itself was ryoge no kan ( a post outside of the ritsuryo system ) .
at any one time , there could be only two myoho hakase and the position was initially appointed to court officials with a rank of shoshichiinoge ( senior seventh rank , lower grade ) .
** the post was later monopolized by people from distinguished families .
** in a kyakushiki ( amendment of the ritsuryo code ) on september 0 , 000 , myoho hakase was instituted at the same time as monjo hakase ( professor of literature ) .
its official position was to teach the law ( myobodo ( the study of codes ) ) at a university in addition to compiling and interpreting the ritsuryo code and kyakushiki .
0 myoho tokugyosho ( distinguished scholars ) and 00 myohosho ( later becoming 00 ) were placed as pupils under a myoho hakase .
later on they were given the important duty of drawing up a myobo kanmon , which expressed their opinions concerning legal matters , and submitting it to a court council such as the jin no sadame ( ancient cabinet council ) .
during the middle of the heian period , myoho hakase tended to be a hereditary post for the sanuki and koremune clans , but from the medieval period , both clans were replaced and it became a hereditary post for the sakagami and nakahara clans of high reputation .
** kuniyaku ( public duties )
** kuniyaku were duties imposed by the imperial court and kokuga ( provincial government offices ) from the heian period to the period of the northern and southern courts ( japan ) .
** in addition , the provincial government officers themselves also imposed duties and collected taxes under a similar pretext .
such imposition of duties by the provincial government officers came to be called the ' kuniyaku ' after the middle of the eleventh century .
in the twelfth century , the local officials in the heian and kamakura periods imposed taxes on residents as one of the kuniyaku ( public duties ) and strived to gain control over the domain .
** in the kamakura period , the imperial court began to develop the public duties with involvement by the kamakura bakufu ( japanese territorial lord as provincial constable ) and shugo ( provincial constable ) .
the muromachi bakufu gained financial revenues by imposing taxes on shugo daimyo and each province under the shugo daimyo .
shugo daimyo themselves also imposed buyaku ( labor service ) , zomotsu ( a kind of tax ) , and tansen as shugoyaku ( taxation on shugo ) in the province .
these impositions were collectively called the kuniyaku .
** the kuniyaku disappeared with the fall of the muromachi bakufu and shugo daimyo .
the edo bakufu forced the various clans , vassals and peasants to perform engineering work ( kuniyaku fushin ) and this can be regarded as the restoration of the system of public duties ( kuniyaku ) .
** naiju
** the term " naiju " means children officials who was engaged in miscellaneous jobs at the imperial palace in the nara and heian periods .
they were placed under the supervision of naijudokoro ( imperial pages office ) ( under naijusho for a short period ) , one of ryoge no kan ( a post outside of the ritsuryo code ) .
its japanese reading is ' chiisana warawa ' ( little children ) .
** it is said that children who served at the imperial palace were called naiju in ancient times .
** though the time of the establishment of naiju system is unknown , they were initially called jushi and were placed under the supervision of jushidokoro ( predecessor of naijudokoro ) .
in the meantime , the term " naiju " was also used as the other name for eunuch during the tang dynasty in china .
both of them were government officials ( fukushin was shohitsu ( assistant director ) and henushi was shochu ( junior inspector ) ) belonged to shibi chudai ( the office of the empress dowager komyo ) .
** in 000 , jushi was renamed naiju and jushidokoro was also renamed naijudokoro ( later naijusho ) .
naijudokoro was abolished in 000 , but it was reestablished later as a small office called naijuzoshi .
however , it was again abolished on november 00 , 000 ( " ruiju kokushi " ( classified national history ) ) .
on february 0 , 000 , it was once again established under kurododokoro ( board of archivists ) ( " nihon koki " ( later chronicle of japan ) ) .
from the above , it is presumed that otoneri took jobs of naiju during the period when naiju didn ' t exist .
it is said that there were two categories of naiju , namely those who were allowed to enter the palace and those who were not allowed to do so .
** according to " engishiki " ( codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) and " wamyoruiju-sho " ( kango ( chinese language ) -japanese dictionary in mid heian period ) , the prescribed number of personnel was 000 and 000 respectively .
** naijudokoro ( imperial pages office )
** naijudokoro was a government office of ryoge no kan ( official post outside of the ritsuryo system ) under the japanese ritsuryo system .
its duties were the supervision of naiju ( imperial pages ) , who were engaged in the security and other miscellaneous jobs at the imperial palace , and related administrative jobs .
** naiju was originally called jushi .
as the term " naigubu jushi " is seen in " shoku nihongi " ( chronicle of japan continued ) dated april 00 , 000 , the system of jushi might have been introduced before then .
also , jushidokoro existed as an office to supervise them ( the time of its establishment is unknown ) .
** when jushi was renamed naiju in 000 , jushidokoro was also renamed naijudokoro .
at that time , the emperor junnin and emi no oshikatsu were in power and it is considered that the above reform was implemented as a measure to strengthen their administration .
ironically , this policy was further strengthened by the emperor shotoku and yuge no dokyo who overthrew the former administration and naijudokoro was upgraded to naijusho ( ministry of imperial pages ) in 000 .
** after the death of the emperor shotoku and the fall of dokyo , however , naiju system was abolished together with naijusho and its jobs were allocated to various offices in 000 .
later , naiju system was restored after being scaled down and naijuzoshi ( naiju office ) was established , but it was again abolished .
naijudokoro was reestablished in 000 and since then , naiju were engaged various miscellaneous jobs , such as notifying a time to people inside the palace , under the supervision of kurododokoro ( board of archivists ) .
according to " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , it was the government office that belonged to chumusho ( ministry of central affairs ) .
** in practice , either governor of ise province or mino province was concurrently appointed to kashira ( prescribed number of personnel was one ) , a person who oversaw routine jobs .
these two posts corresponded to the court rank of shoshichiinoge ( senior seventh rank , lower grade ) and jushichiinojo ( junior seventh rank , upper grade ) respectively .
although the court rank of persons who were actually appointed to these posts was higher than the above , the posts themselves were relatively low-ranking ones in the court .
under them , each one person was appointed to kanjindai ( steward ) ( called shitsuji since 000 ) , daisekikan ( major inspector ) , daisekisoji ( middle inspector ) and besseki ( minor inspector ) .
** senkokushisho ( history compilation bureau )
** senkokushisho was the organization which was established while japan was under the ritsuryo system , for the purpose of compiling official history book rikkokushi ( the six national histories ) and " shin-kokushi " ( the new national history ) .
** therefore , court nobles and government officials who were nominated by the emperor were actually engaged in this job .
however , there are many instances where the name of the organization was unclear and therefore , ' senkokushisho ' is used as a term that means history compilation bureau in a broad sense .
high-ranking court nobles like otodo ( minister ) or dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) were appointed to its head called betto etc . and sangi ( councilor ) class persons were appointed to executive officer .
under them , geki , who actually handled the records , was assigned and benkan ( controller ) , confucian scholars and other officials who were versed in kidendo ( the study of the histories ) joined the team .
** because of its nature , shenkokushisho was abolished once the compilation work of official history book was completed .
** chokushisho
** chokushisho was the organization that succeeded chokushisho ( bureau of edicts ) abolished in 000 .
as with chokushisho ( bureau of edicts ) , it was in charge of commodity procurement and asset management of the imperial family .
** though few historical materials exist that leave a true account , a draft document sent by chokushisho in 000 to todai-ji temple ' s sango ( a monk with managerial role ) was compiled in ' heian ibun ' ( documents of the heian period ) .
in this document , seals of chokushisho ' s officials , including its director ki no kosami and assistant director fujiwara no uchimaro , are seen .
provided , however , that all of officials other than the director and assistant director were those of kuraryo ( bureau of palace storehouses ) and from this fact , it is believed that chokushisho had already been absorbed by kuraryo in effect by that time .
according to " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there existed chokushi toneri ( official of chokushisho ) that belonged to kuraryo as well as storehouses that belonged to chokushisho .
** kanrei-dai ( representative of a shogunal deputy )
** " kanrei-dai " was a job title within the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
** summary
kanrei-dai was a temporary post rather than a permanent one , initially referring to a time when one of the three kanrei families acted as the kanrei ( shogunal deputy ) .
** after the meio coup when dominant figures in politics outside of the three kanrei families held the real power of the shogunate , other personages assumed the post of kanrei-dai .
the most well known among kanrei-dai were yoshioki ouchi , nagayoshi miyoshi and sadayori rokkaku .
** in particular were ouchi and miyoshi , who , despite their commission being temporary , were sometimes even called tenkabito ( ruler of the country ) .
according to shinchoko-ki ( the biography of nobunaga oda ) , nobunaga became jun-kanrei ( deputy kanrei ) , but it is not clear whether or not the position was identical to the post of kanrei-dai or even his assumption of the post .
** jokan
** in another case , in the " myomoku sho " by sanehiro toin , the pronunciation for the chinese characters " 政官 " was said to be " ja-u-gu-ha-mu . "
jokan was never adopted as an official word in the ritsuryo-kyakushiki ( laws of codes and ethics under the ritsuryo system ) however , and it is assumed that it was originally a slang word used within noble society .
** jun-sessho ( associate regent )
** jun-sessho refers to the permission given by the emperor to a kanpaku ( chief advisor to the emperor ) or minister to govern affairs of state as a sesshu ( regent ) under the ritsuryo system , and it also refers to the person who received this permission .
ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system )
there were 00 such examples between the middle of the heian period and the end of the edo period .
** there were two ways that a jun-sessho could be appointed .
** the first type was when an emperor who ascended the throne in his early years celebrated his coming of age .
when an emperor was young , a sessho was placed .
however , when the emperor celebrated his coming of age , the sessho submitted a letter for returning the right of handling political affairs to the emperor .
then the emperor dismissed the sessho and appointed him to kanpaku , and at the same time , proclaimed that he should become jun-sessho , giving him the same right as that of sessho .
in the latter half of the heian period , when emperor goichijo celebrated his coming of age , fujiwara no yorimichi was dismissed his sessho post and was appointed to kanpaku , and it was proclaimed that he should become jun-sessho .
this was the first of such cases .
though not clearly stipulated , in these cases the jun-sessho ' s term lasted until when the emperor became around 00 years old .
** the second type was when an emperor became ill .
in these cases , the kanpaku or the minister handled affairs of state like a sessho while the emperor was ill .
the first example of such a case was when minister of the left fujiwara no saneyori became jun-sessho while emperor reizei was ill during the mid-heian period .
then fujiwara no michinaga , minister of the left , became jun-sessho while emperor sanjo suffered from an illness of the eyes .
there was also a special examples , such as when during the edo period emperor ninko died and the kanpaku masamichi takatsukasa became jun-sessho , following michinaga ' s example .
in these cases , the jun-sessho ' s term was not specifically stipulated , but came to end when the original reason for the appointment no longer applied .
** when a jun-sessho was to be appointed , an imperial decree was prepared by both the gekikata ( officials from the secretaries ' s office ) and the daijokan ( grand council of state ) .
** jinryo bugyo
** " jinryo bugyo " was an official post in the muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
it is considered to be the predecessor of yamada bugyo , one of the ongoku bugyo ( a collective name for the magistrates placed at important areas directly controlled by the government in the edo period ) in the edo bakufu .
** the muromachi bakufu proposed the appointment of tadanobu aisu to jinryo bugyo , and it was approved by the imperial court in around 0000 .
** prior to that , it was recorded in " ujitsunekyoki " ( a diary of the lord ujitsune , 0000 ) that ' the thief rokuro was arrested at yamada , and was decapitated somewhere around ujigaoka shrine .
this is a new practice for a shrine
traditionally , an arrested criminal was handed over to the shugo ( provincial constable ) by a dogo mandokoro ( an administrative office ) , and the shugo executed the criminal . '
** later , yamada bugyo , one of the ongoku bugyo , was established after this model .
** since tadayuki aisu , permission by the imperial court was not required , and daikan ( local governors ) trusted by the kokushi kitabatake clan , such as the sakauchi clan , took the charge as bugyo for the kitabatake clan .
** aisu iyonokami tadayuki , who had his home base at ichinose-jo castle , ise province , having received his appointment to the post of jinryo bugyo , promptly moved to the iwade saishu yakataato ( site of the head priest ' s mansion in iwade ) .
** in " tokitsugu kyoki " ( diary of tokitsugu yamashina ) , written later , there is a description of a saishu ( head shinto priest ) using iwade-jo castle as his home base under the dominance of the kitabatake clan over the ise-jingu shrine ' s estate .
this is the historic site of today ' s iwade-jo castle in iwade omori , tamaki-cho , watarai county , mie prefecture .
** in ' miyagawa yawa so ' ( night stories in miyagawa ) written in 0000 by chobei yasutadatsugu kato , the owner of kokodo in yamada ichishikubo-cho ( present ichishi-cho , ise city , mie prefecture ) , there is a discussion on the ' jinryo bugyo . '
" before the tensho era ( 0000-0000 ) , it was controlled by honshu kokushi ( governor of the mainland ) lord tomonori kitabatake . "
and this description can be understood to indicate that to conclude that jinryo bugyo was the antecedent of the yamada bugyo in the edo bakufu , although the presence of jobu ecchunokami and jinryo bugyo at kameyama-jo castle , shimotsuke okasmoto , is far-fetched .
reference : kiyonao kannagi , " tamaru-jo enkaku ko " ( a study on the history of tamaru-jo castle )
** suito ( shoen )
** " suito " is a position set up for the lower-lanked officers in the shoen manor in medieval japan .
they were in charge of accounting work , such as tax collection , keeping financial records , and computation of land tax , under the instruction of geshi/gesu ( local officials in charge of a manor ) and kumon ( local shoen officials below the geshi in rank ) .
** according to the record in " todaiji yoroku " ( the record of todai-ji temple ) , the treasurer was set up in the toyoinosho in yamato province and omotosho in kii province , where todai-ji temple had its shoen manors .
** suino
** suino was the officer of kurododokoro ( the chamberlain ' s office ) and was in charge of all of general affaires including the receipts and disbursement of the treasury of kurododokoro .
** since the knowledge and skill of clerical work are required for this post , persons who learned myobodo ( study of codes ) or experienced civil officers in government offices were usually appointed to this position .
also , persons who were recommended by influential persons were often nominated .
after his abdication , the emperor uda ordered the secretary of goin palace to compile records of disbursement while he was on the throne , and as seen from this fact , suino had a close relation with the emperor .
during the era of emperor horikawa , however , suino were under restraint since they were regarded as ' arrogant ' since they presided over everything instead of kurodo .
since then , the suino family was restricted to being placed in miscellaneous jobs and jigenin were appointed to the position .
persons of the hirata family inherited the post until the meiji restoration .
** suino , who were once deprived of many jobs , resumed doing jobs of kurododokoro together with the decline of the structure of the imperial court .
** the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , which had just been established at the time , intended to control the imperial court by engaging in the restoration of the well-ordered imperial court .
the intentions by the bakufu coincided with the imperial court ' s intention to restore imperial ceremonies , and the system of jigekanjin was revised accordingly .
also , chigyodaka ( a stipend in terms of the rice production of the fief ) of the hirata family was raised to 00 koku ( about 0 , 000 liter ) and it became the third-ranking jige family .
** since then , the posts of kyokumu , kanmu and suino became hereditary posts , and persons appointed to these posts were called saikanjin who were supposed to command jigekanjin under their respective jurisdiction .
in terms of treatment , however , the hirata family was treated as a family that was inferior to kyokumu oshikoji family and kanmu mibu family which were called ' ryokyoku . '
after the meiji restoration , while both oshikoji and mibu families were conferred baron , the hirata family was treated as shizoku ( family with samurai ancestors ) equally with other government officials .
being jigekanjin , however , suino ' s authority in practical jobs was equivalent to that of kyokumu and kanmu .
at present , a common view of the researchers of the early-modern times imperial court is that the status of jigekanjin at that time was ' sansai ' ( literally , three officials ) structure led by the three saikanjin families of kyokumu , kanmu and suino .
** rinjizoyaku
** " rinjizoyaku " is a collective term for the odd-job tasks that kokuga ( provincial government office ) obliged local farmers to perform as a kind of tax payable in labor or in kind .
** rinjizoyaku was imposed on the manors ( shoen ) as well as public lands , and sometimes the lord of manor asked the kokuga for exemption from rinjizoyaku .
** shinagon
** summary
** kakugon kandachime ' ( warrior nobility of third rank or higher )
** minamoto no toshikata ,
** fujiwara no kinto
** fujiwara no tadanobu
** fujiwara no yukinari
** end of the ' shinagon ' era .
** " shinagon " refers to the four court nobles ( minamoto no toshikata , fujiwara no kinto , fujiwara no tadanobu , and fujiwara no yukinari ) who were active in the era of emperor ichijo in the middle heian period .
the name , shinagon ( four nagons ) , derived from the fact that fujiwara no tadanobu was dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) and the other three served as gon dainagon ( provisional chief councilor of state ) .
** on the other hand , the shinagon were the court nobles who actively supported the government of fujiwara no michinaga .
** minamoto no toshikata was a son of minamoto no takaakira , who fell from his position in the anna incident , and the heir to the book of rituals " saiguki " written by takaakira .
because of his father ' s downfall , toshikata ' s joshaku ( peerage ) was at age of 00 , delayed relative to other court nobles who were conferred peerage at an average age of 00 .
fujiwara sanesuke criticized toshikata , writing " he is notorious for his avarice and conspiracy " ( article on september 0 , 0000 , of " shouki " ) .
afterwards , when toshikata found out about that incident , he conveyed his clear-cut opinion to fujiwara sanesuke ( article on october 00 , 0000 of " shouki " ) .
** in reality , he was the only one of the shinagon who became a member of the imperial court before fujiwara no michinaga came to power in september , 000 .
however , in 0000 , he was overtaken by tadanobu in promotion , and the death of his daughter around same time caused him to decide to become a priest .
in " eiga monogatari " ( a tale of flowering fortunes , vol . 00 ) there is a scene in which michinaga , who had already taken vows , presented a priestly robe to kinto .
as a result , he lived the longest of all of the shinagon .
** fujiwara no tadanobu was a son of dajo-daijin ( grand minister of state ) fujiwara no tamemitsu and a cousin of michinaga .
as described before , in the utaawase held in 000 , when he was invited to participate with michinaga and kinto , he was one year younger than them , and the youngest of all the invited participants .
from november 000 , he served one year as sakone no shosho ( minor captain of the left division of inner palace guards ) together with michinaga .
while he was kurodo no to ( head chamberlain ) , kanpaku fujiwara no michitaka became seriously ill , and this provoked a disturbance in relation with nairan-senshi ( a preliminary inspection of imperial decree ) for michitaka ' s son , fujiwara no korechika .
in 0000 , he was promoted to dainagon , as the only person who attained this post among shinagon , and the next year , when fujiwara sanesuke was appointed to udaijin ( minister of the right ) , he was the only dainagon with the senior rank .
afterwards , longing for the ministerial post that was only one step away , tadanobu frequently prayed for it .
for this , fujiwara sanesuke , who won the post over tadanobu , expressed his discomfort in his diary " shouki . "
however , tadanobu never became a minister , in contrast to fujiwara no yorimichi and his brother norimichi , who became ministers when they were still young , and sanesuke , who enjoyed exceptional longevity for that time .
** fujiwara no yukinari was a grandchild of sessho ( regent ) fujiwara no koretada , but he lost his grandfather and father in his infancy and was brought up by his maternal grandfather .
later , he became famous as one of the three famous calligraphers , and at the same time was know as an excellent official , and served actively as the closest adviser to the emperor .
he also earned michinaga ' s trust to the point that when michinaga became seriously ill , he called yukinari to ask him to be koken ( guardian ) of his legitimate son tsuru gimi ( yorimichi） .
however , on official matters , he sometimes opposed the aggressive policies of michinaga .
although yukinari won michinaga ' s trust , their personal relationship seems to have been a little bit distant in comparison with that between michinaga and the other three .
fujiwara no nagaie , yukinari ' s daughter , was married to michinaga ' s son , but she died early , and then nagaie took tadanobu ' s daughter as his wife , but she also died at a young age .
** in 0000 , the same year that fujiwara no michinaga entered the priesthood , minamoto no toshikata retired from his official post , so did fujiwara no kinto in 0000 consequently and kinto became a priest two years later .
in june 0000 toshikata died , and in 0000 , fujiwara no michinaga and fujiwara no yukinari both died on january 0 .
** moshitsugishu
** " moshitsugishu " was the name of a post in muromachi bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
** moshitsugi in the bakufu also carried out miscellaneous tasks , informed the shogun of the names of people who sought an audience with him , and ushered them to the audience .
** nowadays , moritoki ise ( soun hojo ) is considered to have been one of the moshitsugishu .
** banshu
** " banshu " ( a guard ) is a person who keeps watch at night as part of guard group ( ban ) .
in a more limited sense , it refers to a person stationed in an office of the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) who stood guard for the seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) and his palace .
** after minamoto no sanetomo was assassinated , kozamurai dokoro ( the shogun ' s guard ) was set up , and a system of koban ( small watch teams ) was created , which consisted of 0 teams on a rotating 00 hour watch .
they formed a shogun kinshuso ( a class of shogunal bodyguards ) , which sometimes became a counterweight to the regent ' s power , and provoked political conflicts .
** in the muromachi bakufu , the same system was used , and later it developed into the hokoshu ( the shogunal military guard ) , which was made up of five teams .
** also , in the edo bakufu , the muromachi system was retained as one of the good practices of samurai families , and part of it was used in the system of hatamoto/gokenin ( direct vassals of the shogun and vassals of the shogunate , respectively ) .
that is to say , the banshu system was incorporated into the valet and guard posts such as shoinban ( castle guards ) , sojaban ( an official in charge of ceremonies ) , and tsukaiban ( a person responsible for order and patrol in the battlefield ) .
** azukari ( official post )
** azukari was a post which was set up at government offices , temples or shrines and shoen ( manor ) in the heian period .
** according to " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , azukari was set up at daijokan chuke ( kitchen of the great council of state ) and daijokan fumidono ( repository of documents ) .
in the case of central government offices , azukari was normally placed under betto ( head of office ) and supervised practical jobs instead of betto who was kugyo ( top court noble ) .
azukari was sometimes placed next to betto and shitsuji ( steward ) at in no cho , but the ranking of shitsuji and betto was different depending on government offices .
it is said that the post of nenyo ( subordinate of shitsuji ) , whose term was one year , derived from azukari .
** azukari was set up at shoen as a post which was responsible for the on-site management of shoen and in the case of temples or shrines , azukari was set up as the post which was responsible for the management of temples or shrines .
at kasuga taisha shrine and iwashimizu hachimangu shrine , sho no azukari ( head custodian ) and gon no azukari ( assistant custodian ) were set up as senior posts for shinto priest .
** azukaridokoro
** " azukaridokoro " ( also azukesho , azugasso , azukarisho ) was a deputy position the medieval shoen manor , and integrally controlled it with the official appointment of honjo ( proprietor or guarantor of a manor ) .
** in a legal code book , " satamirensho " published in the kamakura period , it is defined as ' azukaridokoro is the local clerical manager in the manor entrusted by honjo . '
** however , records and references show that the position and scope of azukaridokoro varied widely .
azukaridokoro in general , appointed by honjo , took charge of management of the shoen manor , directing the lower-ranked shokans ( officers governing the manor ) .
to azukaridokoro in the manor , an officer dispatched from honjo , an influential local person , kaihatsu ryoshu ( local noble who actually developed the land ) , or the benefactor of the manor ( or his descendent or a related person ) were often appointed .
however , on the other hand , in case of a shoen manor where existed a multi-layered structure in control such as the honke ( patron ) and the ryoke ( proprietor ) , the ryoke was called azukaridokoro .
in addition , there were cases in which the honke appointed its own keishi ( household superintendent ) or other retainer to azukaridokori , so that he could be supported by the manor instead of receiving his salary .
when a ryoke or a keishi became azukaridokoro , in many cases , he continued living in kyoto , and day to day management was carried out by a trusted deputy .
the former type of local azukaridokoro is called " zaichi azukaridokoro " ( azukaridokoro in the duty station ) , and the latter type of azukaridokoro living in kyoto is called " zaikyo azukaridokoro " .
in the kamakura bakufu , there was a regulation called ' bokan joshi , ' which prohibited gokenin ( immediate vassals of the shogunate ) to be appointed to joshi ( zaikyo azukaridokoro ) or high-ranked shokan ( governor of the manor ) with similar authority .
** to no ben

it was one of the many titles of taishogun ( great general ) and was used on an ad-hoc basis .
** the first seito taishogun in japan was waobu , one of the five kings of wa ( japan ) .
however , the above appointment was made based on the chinese system and in japan , it was nothing more than the title and ranking given by china .

** local lord
** summary
** land lord system
** a local lord ( or " zaichi ryoshu " in japanese ) is an appropriator with the authority to control farmers and fishermen in his territory by executing authority under the shoen koryo sei ( system of public lands and private estates ) in medieval japan .
furthermore , the system for control of land by local lords was called " zaichi ryoshu sei . "
** the local lord had his residence and adjacent farm land , called kadotabata , in his local land .
the local lord had strong private authority over his residential compound ( horinouchi/doi ) , which was composed of his residence and farm land , even under restrictions imposed by the lord of the manor , followed by roju ( vassals ) and genin ( lower ranked people ) .
for protection , his residential compound was equipped with houses for roju and genin , as well as a stable , riding ground , bow and arrow training hall , moat , mound , and storage for seeds and farming implements .
the moat constructed around the residence , which not only provided protection but also served as irrigation , enabled the local lord to enjoy high productivity in the manor .
** the land lord thus became a practical governor , and acquired such rights to judge criminal cases , to collect land tax and to order koji ( public duties ) .
later on , it developed into gokenin ( an immediate vassal of the shogunate ) , or ' sonraku ryoshu ' ( rural lord ) and ' kokujin ryoshu ' ( local samurai lord ) .
** it has been long recognized that during the middle ages , the urban lord class such as the nobility and the temples and shrines had gradually declined , and the samurai class had extended their real power in the political and social spheres .
** in the 0000s , with the advancement of the research on local lords , some scholars started to point out that the ishimoda theory was not enough to capture the whole picture .
some critics have argued that since ishimoda ' s theory emerged , the samurai ' s function as local lords had been emphasized too much , and the fact that the local lord was a part of a violent military system of samurai had been forgotten .
** shikken ( regent for the shogun )
** history
** shikken is a name of a post in the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
shikken supported kamakura-dono ( another name for shogun and it often meant the kamakura bakufu as well ) and controlled the affairs of state .
originally , shikken was the name of the post which was the director of board of administration called mandokoro-betto .
during the kamakura period , mandokoro-betto in in-no-cho ( department under the direct control of the retired emperor ) was also called shikken by following the way that the bakufu called it .
** the first so-called " shikken " was tokimasa hojo who was the father of masako hojo , the wife of the first shogun yoritomo minamoto .
sincetokimasa was appointed to the post of shikken , he provided the hojo family with a foothold of their political power .
since the second shikken yoshitoki hojo started serving also as samuraidokoro-betto ( board of retainers ) , shikken practically became the highest post in the kamakura bakufu .
after the third generation sanetomo minamoto died and the rule of minamoto shoguns came to an end , shikken took the control of the bakufu .
** after the sixth generation nagatoki hojo , shikken had become appointed also from those other than tokuso ( the patrimonial head of the main branch of the hojo clan ) , which was a mainline of the hojo clan .
tokuso and the post of shikken had become separated since then , and the actual power in the bakufu was held by tokuso , then shikken became only a nominal post .
moreover , during the days of takatoki hojo , the nagasaki family at the butler-like position for the hojo clan , which was called uchi-kanrei ( head of tokuso family ) , started seizing power .
** tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord )
** major tozama daimyo
** metaphorical expression
** tozama daimyo was a class of daimyo in edo period defined according to ancestry .
** summary
the term ' tozama ' originally indicated a vassal whose relationship with the lord was not tight .
** tozama daimyo were not involved in the household management within their master ' s house , and responded instead to the master upon notification of military mobilization or the like .
tozama daimyo could irreprehensively secede from vassalage after the fall of the master ' s house .
** tozama daimyo were daimyo who were incorporated into the ruling system of the tokugawa clan before and after the battle of sekigahara .
** many of tozama daimyo ruled large domains , however , they were basically not stationed in the vicinity of the locations of strategic importance including kanto region with edo in the center , kyoto , osaka and those along the tokaido road .
in the early edo period , the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) was wary of tozama daimyo , and condemned them for minor deficiencies , which often resulted in sanction called kaieki : sudden dismissal and deprivation of position , privileges and properties .
** incidentally , some tozama daimyo , who were the tokugawa clan ' s blood relatives or persons of high achievement , were treated equivalently to fudai daimyo , and were also conveniently called jun-fudai daimyo ( quasi fudai daimyo ) .
** the maeda clan ( kaga domain )
the shimazu clan ( satsuma domain )
the mori clan ( choshu domain )
the tosa yamauchi clan ( tosa domain )
the todo clan ( tsu domain )
the asano clan ( hiroshima domain )
the uesigo clan ( yonezawa domain )
the satakae clan ( akita domain )
the hosokawa clan ( higo domain )
the ikeda clan ( okayama domain , tottori domain )
the nabeshima clan ( saga domain )
the kuroda clan ( fukuoka domain )
the date clan ( sendai domain )
** today the word ' tozama ' is often used to mean a stranger .
** fudai daimyo
** narrowly-defined tokugawa fudai
** a list of fudai daimyo
** fudai daimyo were a class of daimyo ( japanese feudal lords ) in the edo period defined according to their ancestry .
** fudai daimyo had a strong vassal relationship with their master , so they were often reproached if they switched allegiance to a new master in the event of their master losing power .
** summary
** definition of fudai daimyo
** fudai daimyo were the daimyo , whom the tokugawa clan had promoted , except shinpan ( tokugawa ' s blood relatives ) , tozama daimyo and their branch domains ( branch families ) .
** fudai daimyo were the daimyo , whom the tokugawa clan had promoted from among the tokugawa vassals at the service from before the battle of sekigahara ( sekigahara no kassen ) .
** fudai daimyo were those who were eligible for a key post of the shogunate .
** families founded by ieyasu ' s patrilineal descendants were in principle called shinpan , but not fudai .
** another example shows that , as in the case of the aizu-matsudaiara family and the takatsukasa-matsudaira family , some families which should have been classified as fudai daimyo could irregularly be classified as shinpan because of being the tokugawa ' s blood relatives .
by contrast , narihiro hachisuka , a biological son of the shogun , was adopted by tozama , and so remained his status .
** besides , some families which were originally tozama daimyo could irregularly be treated as fudai because of blood relationship or great achievements for the shogunate .
they were called " negai-fudai ( jun-fudai daimyo or quasi fudai daimyo ) . "
examples of the negai-fudai included the wakisaka clan , naeki domain , the tozawa clan , the arima clan , the hori clan , the soma clan , the kato clan in yoshiakira kato ' s line , and the akita clan .
** narrowly-defined tokugawa fudai consisted of the families that had been in hereditary vassalage to the matsudaira family , and the families that were promoted by ieyasu tokugawa .
** as the longest-serving fudai , the anjo fudai were favorably treated at the shikoseki , and in case they should have been sanctioned , their family names were in many cases restored in some form soon .
however , yasunaga ishikawa and yasukatsu ishikawa of the anjo-fudai born ishikawa clan ended in tozama daimyo due to their background that they had betrayed ieyasu once and switched the sides before finally joining the ieyasu ' s eastern army .
** various theories of classifying fudai
** in addition , the yamanaka fudai and the okazaki fudai had entered vassal relationship to the matsudaira since the time kiyoyasu had captured yamanaka-jo castle and okazaki-jo castle to be made his honryo ( the main domain ) .
** " mikawa go fudoki ( the topographical records of mikawa province ) " had an article under the heading of kiyoyasu matsudaira with the description of the ' seven anjo fudai families or the fudai of okazaki and yamanaka . '
** the terms ' matsudaira-go fudai ' and ' iwatsu fudai ' were both newly created by a scholar taking into consideration of the whole matsudaira clan including the anjo-matsudaira family , thereby failing to be a historical term .
** the role of fudai daimyo
first , fudai daimyo are characterized by being eligible to an important post of the cabinet officials of the shogunate including the posts of roju ( senior councilors in the edo bakufu ) and wakadoshiyori ( a managerial position in the edo bakufu ) .
it is a major characteristic of the tokugawa regime to appoint members from shinpan to the posts of the shogunate , and to avoid some powerful tozama daimyo with a large domain from joining the politics of the shogunate as a political adviser .
** some points out that it was an exception that masayuki hoshina served the fourth shogun ietsuna tokugawa as his koken ( the guardian ) , but this guardianship was unofficial because masayuki was not appointed to any post of the shogunate .
** another role of fudai daimyo was to keep a close watch on tozama daimyo .
when tozama daimyo and fudai daimyo were stationed in the same province , the fudai daimyo were not required to stay in edo under the sankin kotai system ( the alternate residence system ) , but instead had to remain at their residence ( in their hometown ) .
however , if a tozama daimyo was the ' lord of the province ' and possessed the entire province as his fiefdom , a neighboring fudai daimyo or shinpan would perform his role during his absence .
** the eighteen matsudaira families and the hisamatsu-matsudaira
according to the edo bakufu , when a member from the eighteen matsudaira families which were ieyasu tokugawa ' s patrilineal relatives became daimyo , he was not a ' shinpan ' but ' fudai daimyo . '
the eighteen matsudaira families had had the same roots and split into branches by the time of kiyoyasu matsudaira , who was ieyasu ' s grandfather .
** the hisamatsu-matsudaira family of ieyasu ' s younger maternal half-brother was , needless to say , a fudai daimyo but not a shinpan .
** the following ordering other than that of the matsudaira clan complies with " ryuei hikan " :
( see above for a description of jun-fudai daimyo [not distinguished from fudai in the edo period] . )
** fudai , as from december , 0000 - the mizutani clan ( concurrently appointed so as the akita , arima and soma clans of jun-fudai )
fudai , in and after the era of tsunayoshi tokugawa - the honjo clan
fudai , in and after the kyoho era - the kano clan
** unmentioned in " ryueihikan " - the tanuma clan , the manabe clan , mikawa-matsui clan and yanagisawa clan
** gokenin
** gokenin in the middle ages
** establishment
** go-on to hoko ( patronage and service )
** from the mid-kamakura period
** gokenin of the early modern period
** summary
** family status
** fiefs
** gokenin is a word used to describe the samurai retainers of the shogun but its meaning differed between the middle ages and early modern period .
** these retainers were also referred to as ' kamakura-dono gokenin , ' ' kanto gokenin ' and ' chinzei gokenin . '
** the establishment of the position of gokenin was closely connected to the creation of the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) by minamoto no yoritomo .
however , the relationships between leader and subordinate that existed previously were characterised by individual bonds and , many samurai subsequently elected not to subordinate themselves to yoritomo .
with the subsequent establishment in kamakura of political power in the eastern provinces , one by one the samurai in various provinces came under yoritomo`s control .
the order of prince mochihito was used to control and organize the rapidly increased number of samurai .
those samurai who obeyed this order and came under the control of yoritomo were all regarded as gokenin .
** during the turmoil of the jisho-juei civil war , it was necessary to designate samurai as gokenin ( retainers of a shogun ) even more around the country as opposed to the shogunate ' s stronghold in the east of japan .
in light of this , yoritomo did not impinge on the governors` jurisdiction but made retainers gokenin by guaranteeing status to these gokenin samurai retainers .
** in this way , gokenin retainers consisted of individuals in receipt of shoryo ando ( feudal tenure ) rights directly from the lord of kamakura or hontaku ando ( residential tenure ) rights .
previously many gokenin retainers resided in the eastern provinces of japan and consisted of many veterans who had served under yoritomo from early on .
while gokenin samurai retainers received extensive patronage ( eg . being appointed manor lords ) , they were also obligated to muster in kamakura during times of emergency .
the latter gokenin samurai retainers were organized on province allegiances and called ' kuni gokenin ' ( lit . provincial retainers ) .
after the jisho-juei civil war , samurai throughout japan were made kuni gokenin ( provincial samurai retainers ) following service as obanyaku ( guards in kyoto ) , and many warriors from western japan followed this path to becoming gokenin .
the shugo ( governor ) of each province was responsible for the control of kuni gokenin ( provincial samurai retainers ) , and submitted to the shogunate a register of gokenin who carried out obanyaku ( kyoto guard duty ) as requests for guards increased .
** however , all were treated equally as subordinates of the lord of kamakura .
since the time of yoritomo , master-servant or dominant-subservient relationships between gokenin ( samurai retainers ) were strictly forbidden .
direct relationships with the imperial court were in particular , strictly prohibited .
** gokenin ( samurai retainers ) received patronage and stipends from the lord of kamakura .
patronage consisted of the above-mentioned shoryo ando ( feudal tenure ) and hontaku ando ( residential tenure ) .
gokenin who killed traitors to the shogunate would be granted the traitor ' s territory .
gokenin ( samurai retainer ) were appointed as lords of a manor when the beneficiary of land grants forming an act of shoryo ando ( feudal tenure ) or when granted a land holdings .
after the jokyu war , retired emperor gotoba ' s vast territory was granted to gokenin who had served with distinction .
the granting of this new territory took the form of appointing lords to rule the manors within the territory , and those appointed were called ' shinpo jito ' ( literally new manor lords ) .
** in return for patronage , gokenin ( samurai retainers ) had a duty to serve the lord of kamakura both militarily and politically .
in addition to joining the ranks of the army during wartime , military service also included serving as obanyaku in kyoto and kamakura or guard service in other provinces .
political service was also referred to as ' kanto mikuji ' and consisted of collecting the taxes of rice and money levied on gokenin by the bakufu .
** this reciprocal relationship between the lord of kamakura and gokenin was called ' goon to hoko ' ( literally meaning reward and service ) .
** few gokenin have been identified in historical sources .
with the exception of kanto provinces , approximately ten gokenin ( samurai retainers ) have been identified in a few provinces .
compared to other areas , the provinces of the kanto region had far more gokenin , with the highest count ( approximately 00 ) identified in musashi province and several dozen known to reside in each of the other provinces .
according to a historical source dated from the year 0000 , the total number of gokenin in the entire country was about 000 which indicates gokenin numbers were tightly restricted even within the elite samurai class .
** on the other hand , there were also many so-called ' higokenin ' ( non-samurai retainers ) who did not have a contractual reward-for-service relationship with the kamakura bakufu ( shogunate ) .
the bakufu ( shogunate ) obtained direct power over the higokenin ( non-samurai retainers ) as a result of the mongol invasions of japan however , there were many samurai who did not obey the bakufu .
following the einin no tokuseirei ( debt cancellation decree ) , the preferential treatment of gokenin over higokenin became pronounced and led to rogue elements among higokenin rebelling against the bakufu , imperial court nobles and religious institutions .
** as the kamakura bakufu became ever more powerful , the word ' gokenin ' came to mean ' samurai . '
** gokenin ( samurai retainers ) associated with daimyo ( warrior generals ) of the muromachi bakufu and warring states period
** as the kamakura bakufu became ever more powerful , the word ' gokenin ' came to mean ' samurai . '
the muromachi bakufu did not adopt the gokenin system but the word is frequently used as a paleographical term to refer to hokoshu ( immediate retainers of the shogun ) .
the word gokenin is not used in history textbooks as a term for individuals who had a master-servant relationship with the shogun family of muromachi bakufu .
it is frequently used to refer to those samurai who were direct vassals of the shogun , but also came to be used to refer to retainers of daimyo ( feudal lords ) during the warring states period ( japan ) .
particularly well-known gokenin ( samurai retainers ) hailed from the takeda and mori clans .
** historical source
** `kinnenyaku ( low rank ) gokenin , 0-kan 000-mon ( pay rate ) , yaheimonju hagiwara ( name ) ` and so on .
an entry in a land survey list in the year 0000 at erin-ji temple in kai province .
professor satoshi yada of niigata university explains that in this extracted reference , the term ' gokenin ' was used to differentiate village officials ( sobyakusho ) who became ji-zamurai ( lords of smaller rural domains ) from retainers who originally served the takeda clan .
** those retainers who were privileged enough to be granted face-to-face audiences with the shogun were called ' hatamoto . ' ( direct retainers , lit `flag bearer` )
** many gokenin ( samurai retainers ) in more recent times were foot-soldier samurai but , during peace time were low ranking government functionaries or held police roles .
** gokenin ( samurai retainers ) were generally not permitted to ride on vehicles or horses , or have an entrance hall ( genkan ) to their house .
the definition of `vehicles` however , did not included doorless palanquins .
police attached to the magistrates offices were exempted from this rule and were permitted to ride horses .
there were situations in which skilled gokenin were promoted to high positions usually held by hatamoto ( direct retainers ) , and it was generally the case that a gokenin family would be granted hatamoto status if three successive generations were appointed to hatamoto positions .
** fudai were the descendents of gokenin who had served the shogun family as police from when the edo bakufu ( shogunate ) was founded by ieyasu tokugawa until the fourth shogun , ietsuna tokugawa .
`kakaeseki` ( also called kakaeire ) families were those families had been newly promoted to the status of gokenin .
the so called `nihanba` families occupied a status intermediate between the two preceding statuses .
fudai who had a long and distinguished family history were called ' fudaiseki , ' and they had their own seats within edo-jo castle .
** even when the fudai and nihanba ranked families did not hold an official position within the shogunate , they would receive a stipend and were granted inheritance rights to their estates .
individuals inheriting or appointed to gokenin status were not granted audiences with the shogun ( as a hatamoto ( direct retainer ) could expect .
the status of `fudaiseki` ( hereditary ranked families ) were bestowed the title during a face-to-face meetings with superiors within the castle .
gokenin were ranked below fudaizeki ( hereditary retainers ) and not granted audiences with superiors within the castle but , were granted the status within their own groupings .
** contrasting with gokenin retainers holding fudai and nibanha status were the kakaeseki retainers who were restricted to serving for one single generation and , usually relinquished the gokenin status upon retirement or death .
a market for gokenin titles was known as ' gokeninkabu ' ( lit . gokenin shares ) with a market price determined by whether or not the family status could passed on to other generations .
** the majority of gokenin were generally made up of individuals who either did not hold fiefs but held the rights to 00 to 00-koku in rice or , small land owners holding up to 000 koku of land .
however , hatamoto ( direct retainers ) and gokenin ( samurai retainers ) were differentiated by whether or not they were granted audiences with the shogun .
the value of the stipend did not dictate family status : hatamoto entitled to the smallest stipends received only 00 koku - less than most gokenin .
some gokenin had estates exceeding 000 koku in value but none exceeded more than 000 koku .
from the middle part of the edo period , the fief system began to collapse and there was a shift to rights to rice ( `kuramaidori` ) .
gokenin holding lands in the regions largely disappeared and in their place hatamoto were promoted .
** many gokenin found themselves slip into severe poverty from the middle of the edo period onwards .
it was common for impoverished gokenin to supplement the family income by secretly holding side jobs .
** observation
** science education
** observation means to watch an object carefully to find out its actual condition .
to watch its state and record its change .
it is important how much detail you can find in its change .
** history/politics
one of the various functions of ruling .
** criminal policy
in the subject of criminal policy , this word is often used together with the word " protection " to make a word " protective observation " which in fact means probation .
probation means to send the criminals back to community under a special supervision instead of putting them in the facilities such as prisons .
** natural science
** in the field of natural science , observation is to watch an object carefully to derive something from it and it becomes a base of an analysis .
basically , observation is different from experiment in the way that it does not manipulate the object .
** there are two types of observation - quantitative observation and qualitative observation .
since the sense of human beings is qualitative , quantitative observation is a very important process .
quantitative observation is often especially called " assessment " or " measurement " .
however , qualitative observation often provides with a very important piece of information as well .
see also scientific methods .
** in the field of biology , it is important to carefully watch the appearance of the object and its movements .
however , it became clear that the important elements of living objects are often in the details which cannot be seen with our naked eyes , therefore a magnifier is an important item when you do an outdoor observation .
also in the field of microorganism , the observation is often done by using a microscope .
whatever the case may be in the field of biology , it is important to feel something from an observation as a starting point of an inspiration .
drawing is also valued as a method of recording the result of observation ,
** observation is valued in science education at schools .
the observation of living objects which are familiar to us is often included in the curriculum of the lower classes of primary schools through junior high schools .
** in the social education setting , there are a lot of nature observation meetings or nature observation classes hosted by museums or various nature-related organizations .
** various issues of observation
many people don ' t question about the act of observation itself , however , there is a serious issue involved in it .
** there is a process called " recognition " of human beings involved in the act of observation .
whoever the observer may be ( even an scientist ) , recognition is a process related to psychology and cranial nerve and there are some issues involved as shown below .
** preconceived idea
subjective point of view and objective point of view
** this issue was also pointed out by thomas kuhn .
the progress of scientific theories is largely related to the potential problems of the act of recognition .
( see the section of " paradigm " )
" objectivization " is never simple nor absolute as it is assumed .
** watcher
the people who observe or review a particular field or phenomenon are sometimes called " watcher " .
for example , people often call katsuhiro kuroda ( sankei newspaper , seoul branch manager ) a korean watcher , or toru takanarita calls himself a washington watcher .
** there are also the central food labeling watchers ( ministry of agriculture , forestry and fisheries ) , who make sure there are no misleading food labeling .
** the example that is similar to these is the on-the-road watchers institute , which observes the social phenomena , manners and customs etc which are familiar to us .
see also the section of the study of modern social phenomena about this topic .
** gokamon
** gokamon refers to a family with distinguished family lineage .
it is also called as kamon .
** the gokamon families were allowed to use the surname of matsudaira , iyeyasu ' s former surname .
most of the gokamon including the echizen matsudaira family , head of gokamon , did not take up posts of the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) but were highly respected for their social status as the shogun family .
** the echizen matsudaira family – offspring of hideyasu yuki , ieyasu ' s second son .
the aizu matsudaira family – offspring of masayuki hoshina , an illegitimate son of hidetada tokugawa , the second shogun
the ochi matsudaira family – offspring of kiyotake matsudaira , a younger brother of ienobu tokugawa , the sixth shogun .
** gorenshi
** gorenshi refers to brothers of prestigious families such as the imperial family and families of kuge ( court nobles ) and seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) , and so on .
** especially in the edo period , it referred to daimyo ( a feudal lord ) who moved out from the tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branch families of tokugawa ) and founded its own domain .
families of gorenshi used the surname of matsudaira .
when gosanke did not have an heir , a new lord of the gosanke was sometimes selected from this gorenshi .
** renshi ( or gorenshi ) of each family
renshi of the owari tokugawa family
the matsudaira ( owari ) family of the takasu domain : mitsutomo tokugawa gave a part of their fief to his second son , yoshiyuki matsudaira .
the matsudaira ( owari ) family of the yanagawa domain : mitsutomo owari ( or mitsutomo tokugawa ) gave bunpo to his third son , yoshimasa matsudaira .
the kawatakubo matsudaira family : mitsutomo owari gave bunpo to his 00th son , tomoaki matsudaira . .
renshi of the kishu tokugawa family
the matsudaira ( kishu ) family of the saijo domain : yorinobu tokugawa gave bunpo to his second son , yorizumi matsudaira .
the echizen nibu matsudaira family : mitsusada tokugawa gave bunpo to his third son , yorimoto matsudaira .
the kazurano domain : mitsusada kii ( or mitsusada tokugawa ) gave bunpo to his forth son , yorikata matsudaira ( later yoshimune tokugawa , the eighth seii taishogun ) .
the family had their shikoseki ( anteroom seats for feudal lords and direct retainers of the shogun at the edo-jo castle ) in the upper room of the great corridor , which was allowed only to the families with the highest status in the renshi .
** renshi of the mito tokugawa family
the matsudaira ( mito ) family of the takamatsu domain : yorifusa tokugawa gave bunpo to his oldest son , yorishige matsudaira ( an older brother of mitsukuni tokugawa ) .

** nanate-gumi
** nanate-gumi ( hideyoshi ' s seven troops ) is a group of vassals that was organized by hideyoshi toyotomi . .
they are also called nana-taicho or oumamawari-shichigashira .
** nanate-gumi indicates military units which hideyoshi selected about 00 , 000 elite warriors and divided into seven during his life , and they worked as bodyguards of the toyotomi family and for rituals for the imperial court , and the like .
kumigashira ( commander of each group ) owned the territory valued approximately 00 , 000 koku .
they served hideyori toyotomi after the death of hideyoshi , and mainly focused on protecting the osaka castle during the battle of sekigahara .
( a part of nanate-gumi participated in the battle to support the western army in sekigahara . )
** in later days the kumigashiras appointed directly by hideyoshi retired and their sons succeeded the post , however the troops ' fighting force had weakened significantly .
in osaka-no-eki ( the siege of osaka ) in 0000 , four out of seven nanate-gumi kumigashiras died a heroic death at the time of the fall of the castle .
among them , kazushige aoki was a former vassal of the tokugawa family , but was transferred to the toyotomi family by the hideyoshi ' s special request to ieyasu tokugawa .
therefore , he returned to the tokugawa family after osaka fuyu no jin ( winter siege of osaka ) .

** koji kashin
** koji kashin ( year of birth unknown ) was a magician who made his appearance at the end of the muromachi period .
he was also called " shippo gyoja " ( or " shichiho gyoja " ; written as 七宝行者 ) .
history record indicates that he performed magic before nobunaga oda , hideyoshi toyotomi , mitsuhide akechi , hisahide matsunaga , and others , but there is also an opinion which questions his existence .
** summary
according to " gizankokaku " ( a book of desultory gossip stories ) by guken which is said to have come about at the end of the azuchi-momoyama period , koji was born in echigo province .
although his priesthood lied with kofuku-ji temple in yamato province , due to his excellence in magic of a non-buddhist method , he was excommunicated .
it seems that later , in expectation of becoming a vassal of nobunaga oda , he performed magic in front of nobunaga and was praised , but was not allowed to become nobunaga ' s officer .
** also , according to " old man ' s tea talk " , an essay by ei kashiwazaki during the edo period , in july of 0000 , someone named koji inshin appeared before ieyasu tokugawa in shizuoka city .
ieyasu , who knew koji inshin well , asked , " how old are you now ? " and koji replied he was eighty-eight years old .
if this person was koji kashin , then it means that he was born in 0000 .
also , " japanese miscellany " ( the writings on japan ) by yakumo koizumi contains " story of koji kashin " , according to which , koji called a ship to come out of a drawing , and he boarded the ship and disappeared into the drawing .
there is also a theory that in june of 0000 , he was killed by hideyoshi toyotomi .
** tradition
magic by koji kashin , according to tradition , includes the following :
** when he threw away bamboo leaves on the surface of a lake in nara park , immediately the leaves turned into fish and swam .
** when he used a toothpick to stroke a tooth of a man who did not believe the magic described above , the man ' s tooth dangled as if it would fall out .
** koji was especially close with hisahide matsunaga .
hisahide challenged koji by asking : " i have experienced many dreadful scenes in battlefield , but can you still make me feel scared ? "
koji made the phantom of hisahide ' s wife , who had died several years ago , appear , and frightened hisahide .
** when koji was called upon hideyoshi toyotomi , koji exposed hideyoshi ' s past action which had not been told to anyone , and caused resentment ; koji was captured and crucified .
however , it is also said that at that time , koji transformed himself into a mouse and escaped , and an eagle carried him away in its beaks .
** all of the above can be explained by principles of conjuring tricks ; as such , according to one theory , he is regarded as " koji koshin , the conjurer " .
** works in which he makes appearances
being an unidentifiable person , there is an opinion which questions even his existence .
on the other hand , due to his unidentifiable nature , he often appears in tales of fantastic of later years , as a hermit who waded through the troubled times of the sengoku period , or a mysterious person like ninja .
** chinju-fu shogun ( commander-in-chief of the defense of the north )
** history
** taga ( place name )
** isawa ( place name )
** subsequent history
** chinju-fu shogun was an official who served as shogun , belonging to ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) , which was set up for the defense of the northern area during the nara period and the heian period in japan .
** although there are no historical records referring directly to the origins of the chinju-fu shogun , it has been said that the first chinju-fu shogun was ono no azumabito , who is as we can know the oldest .
at first , the headquarters was called ' chinjo ' and later ' chinju-fu . '
it is assumed that in the year 000 a fortress ( taga-jo castle ) was built located in taga .
mutsu-kokufu ( the provincial office of mutsu province ) was also located in taga .
** the chinju-fu shogun took overall control of military affairs in mutsu and dewa provinces and , commanded samurai from both provinces as well as samurai posted from other provinces .
except for chinju-fu shogun , all the other official posts with the title ' shogun ' were interim ones , and , therefore , chinju-fu shogun was the only shogun existing in peacetime .
regional jurisdictional control often rested with the mutsu region azechi ( inspector ) who concurrently served as the political and military authority .
** chinju-fu ( northern defenses ) shogun confronted the ezo people of mutsu and dewa provinces in the north of honshu ( japan ' s main island ) . .
when a large military movements was required various ad-hoc shoguns ( generals ) and dai shogun ( great generals ) were dispatched from the central government ( along with soldiers from other provinces ) all of which came under the command of the chinju-fu ( northern defenses ) shogun .
** otomo no yakamochi ( believed to be compiler of the japanese classic book " manyoshu " ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) ) , died of illness in the year 000 in the provinces while he was campaigning as chinju-fu shogun .
** sakanoue no tamuramaro who was seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) , built isawa-jo castle in the year 000 , and shiwa-jo castle in 000 .
the chinju-fu ( northern defenses base ) was relocated to isawa either at the same time the castles were built or , possibly some years later .
the precise date is unknown .
it is thought that prior to being relocated to isawa , it was possibly located in shiwa .
subsequent chinju-fu shoguns distanced themselves from the mutsu provincial government and started working in isawa .
** prior to this relocation , the chinju-fu ( northern defenses ) shogun outranked the kokushi ( provincial governor ) and was posted to pacify the northern provinces .
however , after the stalemate of the `barbarian campaigns` ( `sei-i` ) , the chinju-fu post came to control only a part of mutsu province , meaning a demotion to a status somewhat lower than the governor of mutsu province .
elements of the shogun executive bailiwick and that of the provincial governs overlapped sometimes .
intense confrontations frequently occurred between shoguns and provincial governors .
as such , the chinju-fu shogun role was for all intents and purposes converted into an honorary post , and as the shogun seldom stayed in chinju-fu ( northern bases ) , the chinju-fu ( northern bases ) were abolished earlier than the provincial governments .
however , with the outbreak of the zenkunen war ( the early nine year war ) and the gosannen wars ( the later three year war ) , the local military command role was revived as a local commander with sweeping military jurisdiction even in dewa province .
** since chinju-fu ( northern defense ) functions had been substantially pared-back , the honorary post of chinju-fu shogun post was awarded to distinguished samurai .
** incidentally , as an honorary post earmarked for military families , the post was filled by successive taisho ( generals ) hailing from the minamoto clan .
in particular , the yorinobu family line in the kawachi-genji clan availed itself of this important position from generation to generation , starting with yorinobu who handed the role to his son minamoto no yoriyoshi from whence the role passed to his grandson minamoto no yoshiie .
minamoto no yoshiie was the fifth successive generation after tsunemoto ( founder of minamoto clan ) to assume this post .
this practice added cachet to the minamoto clan name as a samurai family , to its ancestors and the founder of the clan , yoshiie .
** the post of chinju-fu ( northern bases ) shogun largely faded into obscurity after minamoto no yoritomo became seii taishogun ( unifying commander-in-chief ) however , during the period of the kenmu restoration , the post of chinju-fu shogun was reestablished and held by akiie kitabatake and others .
** from the kamakura period onwards , the chinju-fu shogun role became defunct except for a certain period of time , however , the significance of the role survived for posterity .
** the term `gosho` ( residence/palace/manor ) was the term used for the domiciles of emperors , the imperial family , government ministers , and monzeki ( chief priests of imperial or noble lineage ) as well as the term of reference used for the residence of a shogun .
the honorific `gosho ' residence term was usually used by imperial family members and nobles ranked higher than sanmi ( third rank ) but , was also used by a chinju-fu shogun , of imperial jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) rank .
** kokushu
** kokushu was one of social statuses of daimyo ( feudal lords ) which existed during the early modern edo period , and it referred to the daimyo having domain of one or more provinces ; another name for kokushu was " kunimochidaimyo " .
this article describes kokushu and junkokushu .
** also , in some cases , the family line which was promoted to the fourth rank were called kokushu kaku ( status of kokushu ) .
** standards of kokushu and kunimochidaimyo
** during reigns of the family , appointment to the jiju ( a chamberlain ) of fourth rank ( jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) ) or higher .
in the case of the first appointment of heyazumi ( an adult-age eldest son who had yet to come into his inheritance ) , appointment to the jushiinoge or higher and having no other family member appointed to goi ( fifth rank ) .
** the lower limit of kokudaka ( a system for determining land value for tribute purposes in the edo period ) was indeterminate .
** however , there are some exceptions to the above standards .
** samurai daisho
** samurai daisho is a man who commands an army under dai shogun ( the great general ) .
or samurai taishogun .
** the role of the samurai daisho was recognized since the genpei war in the heian period , and it is known that there was a samurai daisho called go ito ( 伊藤五 ) in the taira ' s army , and so on .
** myoseki ( family name )
** myoseki ( 名跡 : family name ) is a traditional naming convention that closely links family names of individuals with succeeding generations of a family .
it is also called kamei .
( the written word , 名跡 is pronounced myoseki .
meiseki is not the correct pronunciation . )
** summary
the myoseki naming system mainly applied to the succession of family names amongst the samurai class .
( in samurai families , first names ( `given names` ) are not passed down .
** in business ( the former merchant houses ) the full name of the head of an established business house was handed down from generation to generation .
** in the fields of accomplished arts , entertainment , sumo and the martial arts etc the names ( full name ) of practitioners are handed down .
in the case of sumo , it is not the full name as such that is handed down .
** the practice of handing down names is closely related to the japanese ancient traditions of large families and the ' family system . '
this traditional naming system is difficult for the modern people to understand the due to the demise of japan ' s traditional family system ( that occurred with 0000 revisions to succession and domestic relationship elements of japan ' s civil code ) . .
** according to the traditional `myoseki` naming conventions the name that was handed down was not simply a badge of `trust , ' ' tradition , ' ' history , ' ' good image , ' and ' art/atmosphere``brands` etc .
the ' client list` ( literally meaning house list ) ( = regular customers , patrons , sponsors , backers and money lenders were also included in naming conventions .
in recent times , it has become clear that the client list ( house list ) is a synonym for `profit` .
to carry on a `myoseki` family or business/artistic name , recipients are obliged to assume the entire debts of the myoseki holder ( meaning the individual inherits the money lender relationships from the original myoseki `name` holder ) .
recipients of `myoseki` names are inherit the original myoseki holder ' s large family ( especially obligations to support the family ) .
the implication is that family members must be supported not only while living but also , the graves of dead ancestors of the family must be tended .
it is not clear how this monetary consideration is handled for tax purposes .
with the exception of direct family members , myoseki `names` of toshiyori ( sumo elders ) of the japan sumo association are invariably traded for large sums of money .
** myoseki is , in concrete , a name ( stage name ) , and it accompanies a certain kind of authority and tradition acquired through the process of being handed down and using the same name from generation to generation .
to be defined as myoseki , exactly the same name should be used in perpetuity by successive generations .
** in any case , myoseki naming conventions and rules can still be satisfied if the same stage/professional name ( common business name ) , and the official name in the family register are not necessarily identical to the inherited myoseki name .
however there are cases in which the inheritor of a myoseki name has also changed their registered name .
** myoseki usually indicates a full name .
that is to say however , individuals can not be made to inherit myoseki `names` .
however , in the case of inheritances in samurai families , myoseki `names` indicated only the transfer of the surname or family name .
** public entertainment
even the zenshinza , drama company associated with the japanese communist party adheres to the practice of artists inheriting predecessor ' s acting names as do the avant garde troupes shinpa-geki ( a new faction drama ) and shochiku shin kigeki ( shochiku new comedy ) .
** above all others , the inheritance of names in kabuki and rakugo circles attracts particular public attention .
takeomi nagayama ( president of entertainment firm shochiku ) achieved commercial success by following a policy of ' finding kabuki productions staged around stage `name` succession announcements and career-end performances for the predecessors . '
the same applied to traditional rakugo storytelling events .
use of the term ' myoseki , ' ( inheritance of names ) is by and large synonymous with rakugo and kabuki circles .
in kabuki and rakugo , the longer the pedigree and more celebrated a name is results in the myoseki name inheritance process not being achieved in a single step process but requiring more hurdles to be cleared .
that means , entertainers of the same name may repeatedly stage shows announcing the inheritance of a predecessor ' s name .
at the outset , an entertainer inherits an introductory name ( initially a less significant name ) .
the rakugo world refers to such names as `zenza-mei` ( opening act stage name ) .
the multiple steps to the myoseki process also means that when an actor inherits a particular myoseki stage name this indicates a degree of proficiency has been achieved in their entertainment skills .
also there are myoseki entertainers names that are both `tomena` ( the name indicating highest achievable rank ) and also indicate the `iemoto` ( head of a school/troupe ) authority ( or at least the individual once held such an authority ) .
among various myoseki entertainer names ( including eminent `tomena` ( pinnacle ) and `iemoto` ( school/troupe leader ) -like names ) the prominent names are sometimes specifically called dai-myoseki ( literally meaning great myoseki ) .
in the worlds of kabuki and rakugo , `myoseki` stage names are considered very important and as noted above , entertainers assume a series of `myoseki` stage names in turn .
adherence to the myoseki system is not so pronounced in other fields of the entertainment industry ( ie . besides kabuki and rakugo ) .
for example , in the sport of sumo wrestling , even the most high-ranked sumo wrestlers do not always inherit their predecessor ' s myoseki as their own professional name .
on the other hand , the toshiyori ( sumo elders ) myoseki system is still practiced , although the practice coexists with the single-generation toshiyori ( sumo elder ) system ) .
** the traditional board game `go` was once considered an accomplished art and was run according to the iemoto ( school ) system principles .
the title `hon-inbo` ( literally meaning grand master ) was myoseki name inherited by `go` players .
however myoseki name of players were not inherited in full : each player retained their own individual gago ( pseudonym ) as their first name .
however , the system of inherited hon-inbo ( grand master ) names changed to a merit-based system from 0000 onwards whereby the hon-inbo became a title for the winner of a traditional `go` board game tournament .
the winner of the hon-inbo ( grand master ) tournament of a given year inherits the hon-inbo ( grand master ) title .
similarly , if a player successively wins the major tournament in successive years , the player is granted hon-inbo ( grand master ) myoseki whether or not a title is won in subsequent years . .
** the practice of myoseki inherited names and titles is basically associated with the accomplished arts , but in certain circumstances , a particular family often controls and inherits a name/title because of blood relationships or through adoption .
myoseki nomenclature is not a mere name , but a name or title that signifies inheritance of traditions of a certain accomplished art , which has been traditionally built up by hereditary successors to that myoseki name/title over the generations .
at the time of myoseki name/title inheritance occurs it is not only blood-relation requirements that are taken into consideration .
various other factors are also considered such as : whether the candidate is appropriately inheriting features of the accomplished art , whether the candidate has dominated the art form , or whether the candidate ' s demonstrated skill-levels are deserving of the gravity of a myoseki title/name .
in short , genealogical/family tree factors such as blood-line relationships or student-master relationships are only basic considerations .
however , blood relatives are often permitted to inherit myoseki name/titles even though the candidate has not attained set skill levels , in the expectation that the inheritance will spur the candidate on to further develop their artistic proficiency .
** it should be noted that in kabuki or yose ( vaudeville ) genres , the number of generations who have inherited myoseki names/titles is not precise .
in the case of rakugo ( storytelling ) the reasons for the above are there are several periods where no documentary records remain .
in some cases , some performers lacked skills as artists and were not counted in the number ordering of successive myoseki generations .
sometimes , the number order of generations was adjusted to reflect an auspicious/lucky number , and there is a custom of not counting zenza-mei ( preliminary names ) as myoseki ( conceivably a major inconsistency in defining the numbering of generations ) .
such an example exists with the present rakugo ( storytelling ) artist shota shunputei , who became a leader in his genre while preserving his `preliminary` zenza-me .
there are other examples where a myoseki name is somehow determined without seriously taking into consideration the number of generations .
there are also examples where precisely identical myoseki names/titles exist in two different school/troupe lines in the east ( tokyo ) and the west ( kyoto and osaka areas ) of japan ( tokyo and respectively which sometimes causes confusion .
in addition , in kabuki there are cases in which an sequential numbering of a myoseki generation is granted to a ( deceased ) predecessor posthumously .
in much the same way as numbers are `retired` in professional baseball , the eliminating a certain number from a sequence in itself has significance .
** examples where a child inherits a grander myoseki name/title than the parent .
myoseki inheritance of name/title due to premature death of a parent ( with the exceptions of fukusuke nakamura v ( nick-named `kei-chan` ) , tatsunosuke onoe etc ) :
** utaroku iii

baijaku
sanpei
shozo ( inheritance may correspond with him having an `earlier blood-relative` ) .

bunji x

koencho iv
there are also many examples of children cultivating unprecedented dai-myoseki ( `grand` celebrate names/titles/reputations ) ( eg : encho , ganjiro , kichiemon : all of them being first in their generational line ) .
** furthermore , there is a principle regarding brothers of the same family whereby the first son inherits his family ' s own myoseki , whereas the second son inherits the myoseki name/title of another family ' .
on occasions the younger sibling unexpectedly obtains a higher ranked myoseki name/rank than the elder sibling .
** samurai families and myoseki
to differentiate the processes , the terms are used when a person having a different family name changes the blood line of that family by inheriting the family ' s myoseki .
** moreover , the case of the hatakeyama clan is a typical example of such a myoseki inheritance .
shigetada hatakeyama was one household within the chichibu-heishi ( taira clan ) that could trace its roots back to emperor kanmu .
when shigetada was vanquished ( along with his sons ) by tokimasa hojo ( shigetada ' s father-in-law ) , tokimasa forced his daughter ( ie . shigetada ' s widow ) to marry yoshizumi ashikaga whereupon , yoshizumi took over the hatakeyama clan ' s territory .
accordingly , yoshizumi ' s descendents came to be identified as the hatakeyama clan and changed allegiances from the from taira clan across to the minamoto clan .
** hyakkan na
** hyakkan na refers to an official-rank-style name that samurai called himself .
** therefore , in formal occasions , such official names of the government office as given by shugo daimyo were omitted or replaced by different names .
also there appeared other cases in which offspring succeeded government posts which their ancestors had been appointed to , and thus a new custom of jikan , in which samurai used a government post at his own initiative without permission from the imperial court , became established .
** since around the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( japan ) , a custom in which samurai used a name without his government post as his own name occurred among the samurai class , and continued by the end of the edo period .
samurai used hyakkan na putting it after the name of his clan or surname , and before his imina ( a personal name ) ( in japan a surname comes first , and followed by a first name ) .
** ichiryo gusoku
** tosa monogatari described it as fearless wandering samurai .
** summary
to respond a sudden call-up without delay , they always carried their spear and armor during their farm working , thus they called ichiryo gusoku .
since they were such part-time soldiers , ichiryo gusoku were exempted tasks obligated to ordinary samurai .
** as they were engaged in farm working , many of them were robust and had aptitude for group work , accordingly they were considered to have been high-leveled soldiers .
however , in the nature that they were concurrently farmers , it is considered to be hard to mobilize them during the busiest farming season and thus it was impossible to make them fight battles over a long period of time .
** history
ichiryo gusoku was invented by kunichika chosokabe ( other theory says it was invented by his vassal , takayori yoshida . ) .
it was motochika chosokabe , the son of kunichika , who made use of ichiryo gusoku eagerly and effectively .
motochika , leading powerful ichiryogusoku , achieved the unification of shikoku region , however , the territory was reduced to only tosa province due to hideyoshi toyotomi ' s shikoku conquest .
** katsutoyo yamauchi was given the tosa domain as the successor of the chosokabe family , however , the remnant corps of the chosokabe family did not necessarily welcomed the new lord .
soemon takeuchi and his ichiryo gusoku members refused to hand over the urato-jo castle and demanded that morichika should be given a part of the old territory , or ' half land of tosa ' ; this is called ' urado riot ' .
katsutoyo yamauchi sent his younger brother , yasutoyo yamauchi , to suppress it .
the remnant corps resisted this by holding the urato-jo castle , but eventually surrendered the castle and capitulated due to an act of treachery from within the castle .
000 members of ichiryo gusoku were reported to be decapitated and their heads were salted to send to naomasa ii in osaka .
** after that , ichiryo gusoku incited rebellion , such as takiyama riot led by samanosuke takaishi .
in tosa province , goshi was strictly distinguished from feudal retainer of domain , creating conflicts between the superior and inferior throughout the edo period .

** official court titles for samurai
** prehistory
** the official rank in the military government from the sengoku period to the azuchi-momoyama period
** the official rank in the military government during the edo period
** special exceptions in the name of the official rank
** the detested post
** the japanese term buke-kani is used to refer to the official ranks ( official posts and court ranks ) that samurai were granted or adopted for themselves mainly from the sengoku period ( japan ) to the edo period .
** formerjuryo ( local officers ) who were sent to rural areas as kokushi ( provincial governors ) or mokudai ( representatives of kokushi ) and settled down in the area contributed significantly to the formation of groups of samurai .
they used their official rank to dominate the area and extend their power .
once the power of warriors began to grow , those in power attempted to get them under their control by giving them official ranks .
since the official rank still held the power of authority even after the ritsuryo system broke down and its actual meaning was lost , it was used to clarify the rank order of the warriors .
at the same time , it was also used to show the domination of the imperial court over the warriors .
** once the military government was established , yoritomo minamoto banned gokenin ( low-ranking vassal ) from being appointed to an official rank without yoritomo ' s permission to tighten the control over them .
the muromachi bakufu also followed the procedure .
** in the sengoku period ( japan ) , the power of the bakufu declined and the number of cases called chokuso was increasing , which means daimyo directly negotiates with the imperial court and receives the official rank .
when the imperial court was in short of money , daimyo donated their money asking for an official rank in return and the imperial court often issued one which was higher than their family status in return .
the official ranks started being used not only as a sign of authority but also as a legitimacy of the control of the territory as well as a justification of a battle .
** during this period , there were also an increased number of warriors who used self-appointed posts without getting permissions from the imperial court .
the post called kazusa no suke ( assistant governor of kazusa province ) that nobunaga oda used in his early days is one of the examples .
the post called chikuzen no kami ( governor of chikuzen province ) that hideyoshi toyotomi used when he was serving the oda clan as its general is considered to be one example of the above .
** once hideyoshi toyotomi succeeded in dominating the whole country as kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) , the highest aristocratic rank , he started to try controlling daimyo throughout the country by giving them official ranks and incorporating them into the ritsuryo ranking system .
however , the promotion system of the official rank stopped functioning since too many warriors were awarded to the higher ranks while the official ranks to be given to the court nobles were already in short .
strictly speaking , this is a serious matter for the imperial court , however , kamei ' s post returned to the one within the country after hideyoshi ' s overseas operation had failed .
** once ieyasu tokugawa established the edo bakufu , leaning from the bad experiences during the toyotomi regime , he started to reform the ranking system while still using it as a tool to control the warriors .
first of all , he separated the official rank in the military government from the one for the court nobles by dealing the former as ingainokan ( the posts exceeding the original limit ) under the laws governing the imperial court nobility ,
this change prevented the situation which warriors possession of official ranks get in the way of the promotion of court nobles .
also all the official ranks in the military government virtually had to be appointed by shogun , and his permission was required even though some daimyos and shogunal vassals were directly nominated by the imperial court .
** the official ranks given to daimyo are matched to the house of urin , and the ranks were as follows .
jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) , or shodaibu ( fifth rank ) - ordinary daimyo
jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) , or shihon ( fourth rank )
** the official posts were as follows .
jiju ( chamberlain )
provincial officials ( including the kuroda family , the nabeshima family ) were in the rank of jushiinoge-jiju ( junior forth rank , lower grade chamberlain ) .
the nanbu family , the yanagisawa family and assistant provincial officials ( including the niwa family , the tachibana family ) started as the rank of jushiinoge or jugoinoge and they were promoted to jushiinoge-jiju later on .
the oda family was in the rank which was one below assistant provincial official in the early days of edo period ( its family status was demoted due to " meiwa incident " and " uda disturbance " ) .
a part of fudai ( daimyo who had been vassals of the tokugawa clan for generations ) such as the sakakibara family were ranked as jugoinoge and promoted to jiju later on .
a part of fudainami ( the non-fudai families who were treated at the same level as fudai ) , and negai-fudai ( the non-fudai family who became fudai by marriage or by request ) such as the sanada family were ranked as jugoinoge and promoted to jushiinoge later on .
gonchujo ( provisional middle captain ) - the hoshina family ( the aizu matsudaira family ) , the shimazu family , and the date family
sangi , also called saisho ( royal advisor ) - the maeda family , and kamon , a part of the tokugawa family ( the tatebayashi family , the kofu family )
gon chunagon ( a provisional vice-councilor of state ) , also called komon -the mito tokugawa family
gon dainagon ( a provisional chief councilor of state ) , also called asho - the owari tokugawa family and the kishu tokugawa family
also the gap between the status of families was created by subtly adjusting their initial posts or the speed of their promotion .
** however , use of the post required the permission of the bakufu , and they used it as a tool to control daimyo by setting special exceptions for some posts .
the details are as follows ;
** a ban on sharing a same post between the families having a same surname .
** to avoid confusion
** among kunimochi daimyo whose surname were matsudaira , a prioirty was given to use their territory name for the posts .
** kaga no kami ( the governor of kaga province ) for kaga-maeda family ( the surname matsudaira was given by the bakufu ) , echizen no kami ( the governor of echizen province ) for echizen-matsudaira family .
** among kunimochi daimyo whose territory was large , a prioirty was given to use their territory name for the posts .
** a ban on sharing the same post as the one of roju ( senior counselor ) who does not have a seat in shikoseki of the edo castle .
** when one is promoted to roju ( senior councilor ) , the daimyo who has the same post and the bakufu officials in his charge get transferred .
** the case that territory names were used by daimyo other than kunimochi daimyo .
** a ban on the use of the post such as mikawa no kami ( only allowed for the tuyama matsudaira family ) , musashi no kami and yamashiro no kami ( from march 00th , 0000 )
** standing in awe of the bakufu and the imperial court , the above names were not used .
** the posts such as jibushoyu ( mitsunari ishida ) and owari no kami ( harukata sue , norihide matsuda ) were also detested .
** it seems strange that the post of kozuke no suke which had an ominous impression was used by many daimyo and shogunal vassals , and those such as masazumi honda , masanobu hotta , yoshihisa kira and the mikawa oguri family all had a miserable end of their lives .
** its reason and its criteria are unknown .
** shodaibu ( aristocracy lower than kugyo )
** shodaibu is the name of class of government officials ( especially one of low to medium rank ) , which was used from ancient times through medieval period to the early-modern times in japan .
** top ranking officials for practical works , who supported the system of the dynasty state from tenth century to twelfth century , were mainly from the families of this class .
substantial operation of government-regulated organization or facility in imperial court was done by officials from this class .
and also , as you can see that sei shonagon and murasaki shikibu who developed dynastic style literature were court ladies from this class , people from this class were the important bearers of the culture of dynasty .
high-ranking warriors in this period also belonged to this class as officials for practical works in charge of military art , and supervised general samurai in samurai class by making them kenin ( retainers ) .
** in recent times , keishi ( household superintendent ) such as hereditary house of prince and sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) were considered to be equivalent to this class in the imperial court and became the official title for them .
in samurai family , fifth rank daimyo ( japanese feudal lords ) and hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu , which is a form of japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) were equivalent to this official court rank and called with this official title .
** goshi ( country samurai )
** summary
** examples of goshi
** harakatashu ( the yonezawa clan )
** tosa goshi ( the tosa clan )
** higo goshi ( the kumamoto clan )
** satsuma goshi ( the satsuma clan )
** goshi is historical terminology referring to samurai hierarchy that existed during the edo period .
although it is difficult to establish a common definition because actual rank and method of rule differed depending between the bakufu ( shogunate ) and each clan .
in a general sense , the term `goshi` came to refers to lower-ranking samurai residing in rural villages .
gosho ( rural samurai ) were permitted to adopt a surname and to wear a pair of swords .
the origins ( birthplace etc ) of many gosho ( rural samurai ) was well known .
** the status of goshi ( rural samurai ) was generally middle class : somewhat lower than samurai ( hanshi ) residing in castle towns but , higher than peasants .
** goshi are mainly divided into the following .
** there were examples of goshi who held the rank of samurai prior to the `heinobunri` system ( separation of samurai from farmer roles ) coming into effect , but continued to reside in rural areas while maintaining the rank of samurai .
** the goshi ( rural samurai ) experienced a change in status of their main residences , were forced to relocate or were not permitted to leave their local area and were given permission by the feudal lord to be goshi .
these people were influential local leaders , and there were many examples where a new feudal lord made such people goshi in the samurai class , as an appeasement policy , instead of giving them a farming rank .
** because there were no forced relocations of daimyo families from the middle ages onwards , there was insufficient separation of samurai and farmers amongst the ranks of vassals and as such , the fiefs of provincial samurai perpetuated and the goshi continued to live in rural villages . .
** there were some examples of peasants and townspeople who were promoted to samurai .
** individuals who were peasants and townspeople ( eg . prosperous merchants or wealthy farmers ) were awarded samurai status ( by becoming goshi ) as a reward for monetary tributes paid to the daimyo or in recognition of developments in new pursuits .
those prosperous merchants or wealthy farmers were often decedents of provincial samurai or family/vassals of daimyo who was punished during the sengoku ( warring states ) period by being dispossessed of their lands .
** others
there were some examples of lower-ranking samurai who could not survive just living on their karoku ( hereditary stipend ) in a castle town because of their low status and because they were not allowed to farm in agricultural villages or the outskirts of the castle town .
** specially exempted samurai ( eg . goshi hailing from the totsugawa area in nara and others ) .
** the above goshi were categorized depending on the process by which they became goshi , however the essential elements they had in common were categorized as follows :
** the leading researcher of the goshi , motoi kimura defines goshi as having the following 0 characteristics :
** goshi were clearly differentiated depending on whether they resided in a castle town or in a rural village
all or a part of a goshi`s land forming their fief was given to them and was the basis of their livelihood .
within a the hierarchy of a grouping of vassals , an individual was given a formal ranking of `goshi` .
the goshi had to bear the burden of military service but , there were cases where this did not occur .
** moreover , kimura ( the academic mentioned above ) points out that there are individuals who are easily mistaken for goshi , however , those individuals who are difficult to be considered as goshi as mentioned as follows :
** it is necessary to exclude these individuals by virtue they are in a different category to goshi .
** castle town based samurai who for some reason or other lived in rural hamlets .
vassals of a daimyo ( commander ) but residing in a rural hamlet .
individuals from the upper rungs of peasants and village headman permitted to dress as samurai , use a surname and wear a pair of swords .
** it is particularly easy to confuse goshi with individuals in this third category : upper-rung peasants and wealthy merchants , dressed the same as samurai , permitted to adopt a surname and wore a pair of swords .
in this case , the foundation of this 0rd group ' s livelihood was the possession of agricultural land or a commerce , and they did not belong to the ranks of vassals .
** although they were not of goshi status , peasants and city dwellers with special rights allowing them to use a surname and wear swords existed in every province .
** although of peasant status , such individuals held regional power , were appointed as village officials ( eg . headman ) at the lowest end of the ruling structure , or their children were used as common foot soldier by the satsuma clan .
** such individuals received special dispensation to use a surname and wear swords by virtue of their responsibilities and contribution to the fringes of the fief ' s finances and control .
** in addition , there are examples where within goshi classes there was further sub-division .
** furthermore , in various periods/provinces , legitimate samurai below the rank of kishi ( mounted samurai ) that held special military rights were referred to as `goshi` ( like titles given to an english esquire or a spanish hidalgo , etc . ) .
** please also refer to the respective paragraphs relating to samurai from the totsugawa area in nara and junior officials in hachioji .
** the uesugi clan in the yonezawa domain was a dai-daimyo ( a grand feudal lord ) family of a 0 . 0 million koku income subordinate to the toyotomi government , however , after the battle of sekigahara , their wealth was reduced to 000 , 000 koku .
however , the uesugi clan struggled financially because the clan did not press any vassals into service .
on top of this , in 0000 the third lord of the clan ( tsunakatsu uesugi ) died suddenly leaving no successor .
normally , a change in the rankings would result in grain tributes being reduced by half to 000 , 000 koku but , special permission was given to tsunanori uesugi ( son of yoshinaka kira ) to become an adopted son .
due to rice stipend being reduced in half and no vassals pressed into service , the lower ranked samurai clansmen ( who had been living in the confiscated fukushima-jo castle ) were allocated homes and farmland on the outskirts of the castle town below yonezawa-jo castle , .
the clansmen were not allocated a domain as such , nor given an amount sufficient for the upkeep up their household , but were told instead to concentrate on working their farmlands in normal times , and were only required to perform military duties on an ad hoc basis .
these lower-class samurai were called harakatashu .
in the pictorial map of the castle provided to the shogunate , the districts where people lived on the plains were marked as residential areas of samurai .
** prior to the battle of sekigahara , as a conciliatory gesture , older vassals of the chosokabe clan ( that controlled the shikoku region and who had been farmer-warriors ) were made goshi .
whilst it can be said the goshi from tosa domain were samurai , they suffered from systematic discrimination compared to other domains resulting in a situation where although the upper samurai ranks of tosa were domain samurai all the same , there was latent confrontation and antagonism .
at the end of the edo period , when the authority of the bakufu and the clans had diminished , many of the tosa goshi committed themselves to a movement whose rallying cry was ' revere the emperor and expel the barbarians` .
** also in the domain there was a policy of conciliation whereby the tosa goshi were honored with the special title of `shirofuda` ( based on family line or merit ) so they would receive the same treatment as upper ranking samurai . .
hanbeta takechi was awarded the `shirofuda` rank .
** in such cases , their actual title was not `goshi` , but zaichu gokenin ( literally meaning lower ranked vassal ) .
initially because of a need for administration of rural areas etc , samurai status was conferred upon surviving retainers of the previous domain rulers ( konishi and kato clans ) who had returned to farming as well as local clans .
furthermore , foot soldiers who returned to faming were given goshi` ( rural samurai ) status and as such were permitted use a surname and wear swords as well as guard province borders and to patrol frontier areas . .
examples of this include a regional regiment of unpaid/honorary fusiliers called ' jizutsu and korizutsu ' .
in reality , it was a fusilier regiment in name alone and its members were mobilized to serve as local officials lower ranking samurai to work on an ad-hoc basis in edo ( now modern day tokyo ) .
in a strange twist , inquisitive sons of goshi ( rural samurai ) made use of these arrangements to volunteer as foot soldiers to serve in edo as a means to broaden their horizons .
basically , the status conferred this way almost identical with that of the foot soldiers ( with the exception of ' ichiryo-ippiki ' ( goshi senior hosokawa clansmen ) and upper-rank rural based samurai ) .
the practice of `buying` goshi status also gave rise to gossip : recipient were called ' kaneage zamurai ' ( literally meaning `give you money samurai` ) .
from the meiji period onwards , their descendants who in turn had inherited warrior class status were sniped at as ' kaneage shizoku ' ( literally meaning `give you money samurai descendants` ) .
** furthermore , samurai such as those who were minor provincial lords at the time of the sengoku ( warring states ) period , regional samurai , and those in the unified shimazu clan army in kyushu were included in the ranks of vassals as goshi .
for the above reasons such goshi samurai were also called `tojoshi` ( literally meaning `samurai outside a castle` ) .
the duties of the `tojoshi` were identical with those of clan affiliated samurai and included roles such as : participating in the sankinkotai detail ( where feudal lords were required to spend alternate years residing in edo ) and , military service .
** it was also common for goshi to be appointed to posts such as oshima daikan tsukiyaku ( a post under the local governor in amami-oshima island ) .
however , even after that , there were still changes in status because of adoptions between goshi and jokashi and commuting relationships .
also , there were many examples of individuals becoming `goshi` ( regional samurai ) after migrating from the kagoshima region to other areas following the setting up of formalized `jokashi` ( literally meaning samurai outside a castle ) structured family systems .
** moreover , there was a hierarchical difference amongst goshi : middle and upper ranks resided in samurai residential districts called `fumoto` and in effect ran the local government administration .
also , when a samurai became a senior ranking goshi they controlled vast farming lands , forests and mountains , and moreover , it was possible for them to trade produce among samurai in the satsuma clan .
this led to many goshi ( rural samurai ) using their trading right to the limits allowed and , although of lower status , many goshi lived more prosperous lives than their higher-ranked jokashi ( samurai outside castles ) counterparts .
however , the majority of goshi were considered `mudaka` ( receiving no stipend in the form of a share of crop yields ) .
these unsubsidized `mudaka` goshi made their livings by pursuing those professions permitted by the clan ( carpentry , cottage industries ) and , amongst the goshi there were individuals who maintained their senior goshi status whilst working as tenant farmers .
** following the meiji restoration , there were many goshi who successfully purchased and accumulated land holdings in contrast to jokashi/clan samurai who lost their stipends and were ruined .
many goshi also maintained a frigid attitude in relation to the satsuma rebellion .
afterwards , many jokashi ( outside castle samurai ) departed kagoshima/home towns and leveraged clan links in pursuit of careers as central-government bureaucrats or in the military whereas those of goshi origin formed cliques within the police .
many goshi who did not relocate to urban centers often pursued careers in local areas as : public servants , teachers , police officers , or firefighters .
it is said that in pre-war kagoshima prefecture , it was extremely difficult for ' heimin ' ( commoners ) to secure public service roles in a new government .
in 0000 after the war ended and until the general headquarters of the allied powers ( ghq ) took control , this political structure remained unchanged in kagoshima political structures .

** otogishu ( advisers )
** summary
** hediyoshi and otogishu
** otogishu is the official duties , which existed in families of sengoku daimyo ( japanese territorial lords in the sengoku period ) from the the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) to the early edo period .
** otogishu were the close advisers who were called to their lord ' s side and gave advice about politics and military affair , while they also reported buhenbanashi ( anecdotes about the life of samurai ) or situation of various districts to their lord .
otogishu was also known as ohanashi-shu ( collocutor of the load ) , gohobanshu ( officials who accompany shogun ) and the brains .
** after edo period , shogun and territorial lords still had otogishu , however , as political power passed into the hands of chief retainers , power of otogishu had gradually weakened .
** it is said that their storytelling spread among the common people and became the origins of kodan storytelling and rakugo ( traditional comic storytelling ) .
** as hideyoshi toyotomi was not very good at reading and writing , in order to make up for that he had many otogishu for learning by the ear .
according to one theory , he had 000 otogishu .
and also , many otogishu of hideyoshi came from a good line such as the old shugo family , the family of former his master , or higher ranking busho ( japanese military commander ) than him .
it is said that hedeyoshi appointed those people as otogishu to show that the man like him from low-class now rose to the highest rank ( possible for the subject ) in a country and even people of good birth and people from historic families served him .
** hideyoshi ' s otogishu from samurai family include yoshiaki ashikaga , nobukatsu oda , nagamasu oda , narimasa sassa , toyokuni yamaya , keijhun miyabe , katsutoshi takigawa , shigenari furuta and nagachika kanamori .
those from townspeople include sen no rikyu , sokun imai and shinzaemon sorori .
** they supported the reign of hideyoshi at domestic affairs and gave rise to magnificent momoyama culture , while they formed a part of later japanese culture , such as completion of wabicha ( wabi style of tea ceremony ) that pursued simplicity .
** vice shogun
** vice shogun is the post of military officer which was ranked the next position of " dai shogun ( the great general ) " or shogun in japan .
under the ritsuryo system , ranking in order of dai shogun , shogun , vice shogun was stipulated , however , in fact , vice shogun was directly placed to dai shogun , eliminating shogun .
moreover , there was government post as adjutant , a vice-fukushogun ( vice-shogun ) .
** vice shogun under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code )
under the ritsuryo system in japan , there was stipulations concerning vice shogun in article 00 of gunboryo ( the statute on military defense ) .
according to this , when a commander went to fight , if the number of soldiers was more than 00 , 000 , one shogun and two vice shogun were supposed to be placed .
and , dai shogun was placed in every three troops .
in fact , against the stipulations , one to a few vice shogun were appointed .
and , shogun was never placed under dai shogun but vice shogun was directly placed under dai shogun .
in the history book , vice shogun is also written as " vice commander " ( the chinese character of commander used in the book had almost the same meaning as shogun ) .
** for example , otomo no otomaro was appointed as seito vice shogun in february , 000 .
vice-fukushogun was placed under vice shogun .
then , in 000 , after funya no watamaro was appointed as seii shogun ( great general who subdues the barbarians ) , otomo no imando , saeki no mimimaro and sakanoue no takakai received an official appointment as vice shogun .
** with an end of conquest of ezo and appointment of shogun and daishogun , appointment of vice shogun had became rare .
in mid heian period , there is a written record that minamoto no tsunemoto was appointed as seii vice shogun during the johei and tengyo war on march 00 , 000 .
** vice shogun in muromachi period
in muromachi period , vice shogun was not permanent , but appointed once or twice .
** in 0000 , the early muromachi period , tadayoshi ashikaga , younger brother of takauji ashikaga was appointed as seii fukushogun .
and also , there is a written record that norimasa imagawa , who played a role in quelling war of zenshu uesugi , was appointed as vice shogun .
** at this time , satomi clan , daimyo in the sengoku period proclaimed himself as kanto vice shogun , following yoshiaki .
** appointment by yoshiaki ashikaga
on august , 0000 , there is a written record that the fifteenth shogun yoshiaki ashikaga asked nobunaga oda , who performed great deeds for yoshiaki ' s assumption of the post of shogun , to serve as vice shogun or administrative post .
however , it is said that nobunaga declined this offer .
after yoshiaki and nobunaga were opposed to each other , yoshiaki asked ieyasu tokugawa , an ally of nobunaga , to become the vice shogun in order to win him to yoshiaki ' s side , but it is said that ieyasu declined this offer .
** after yoshiaki was expelled from kyoto by nobunaga and came under the patronage of mori clan in tomo , bingo province , he appointed terumoto mori as vice shogun and tried to re-establish muromachi bakufu in tomo .
although nobunaga was killed by rebellion of mitsuhide akechi , the ruling power was shifted to the hand of hideyoshi toyotomi , and yoshiaki was not able to re-establish muromachi bakufu .
** vice shogun in edo period
** however , the lord of the mito domain , one of the tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of tokugawa family ) is often called as a vice shogun in the world or vice shogun in mito .
for these reasons , it is said that the lord of mito domain became to be called the vice shogun .
** this is not an official but familiar name , that was named by the fact written above .
these theories are still believed to be common saying , but feudal retainers of mito domain at that time strongly believed these stories .
instead , as the mito-tokugawa family was held in high esteem as the assistant for shogun , kodanshi , professional storyteller told that the mito-tokugawa family was the world famous vice shogun .
** " vice shogun " today
** joshi ( upper-class samurai )
** tosa domain ' s case
** joshi was an upper-class feudal retainer in the edo period .
when samurai were classified from the upper to lower classes as joshi , heishi , and goshi , joshi was the highest social standing among them .
** the tosa domain was known for creating a strict distinction between joshi and goshi ( country samurai ) .
** the difference is analogous to that between fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassalage to the tokugawas ) and tozama daimyo ( a daimyo who was not a hereditary vassal of the tokugawa family ) .
** hanpeita takechi , who organized the tosakinno party in the last days of the tokugawa shogunate , and ryoma sakamoto were goshi while hisamoto hijikata , shojiro goto , and taisuke itagaki , who assumed key posts after meiji restoration , belonged to joshi .
** kyooyaku ( a person in charge of the entertainment )
** mostly , tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) was appointed as kyooyaku .
kyooyaku was also called " gochisoyaku " , " settaiyaku " or " kanbanyaku . "
it is known that asano takumi no kami , who was famous for chushingura ( the treasury of loyal retainers ) , served as kyooyaku for the imperial messenger when he had a sword fight with kira kozuke no suke .
** in response , the emperor and the retired emperor dispatched their messengers to edo for a return visit from the end of february to mid-march .
this was an annual event in the edo period .
** as entertaining the messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor cost a huge amount of money , the edo bakufu appointed only tozama daimyo as kyooyaku to prevent them from saving extra money .
kyooyaku daimyo also had to give expensive gifts to koke as instruction fees .
according to " tokugawa jikki " ( collection of official records of the edo bakufu ) , it was 0000 when a series of custom ( imperial messengers leave the capital and daimyo entertain them ) was established .
** and except this event , as messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor were sent to edo and/or nikko when needed , kyooyaku was selected each time .
** chokushisho ( bureau of edicts )
** summary
** chokushisho was an extra statutory office established in the latter half of the nara period under the ritsuryo system .
chokushisho attended the emperors and ex-emperors and managed to implement the imperial orders smoothly ; it also administered and managed the imperial estate .
** empress koken abdicated the throne in favor of emperor junin because of illness ; however , she recovered from the illness due to buddhist priest dokyo ' s prayer and began positively intervening in the emperor junin ' s administration .
gradually , confrontation emerged between the retired empress koken and the emperor junin .
there the retired empress established chokushisho in 000 .
chokushisho functioned as the retired empress ' s secretariat office , procured goods and services over the head of the great council of state .
even after the retired empress ascended the throne again , chokushisho remained as dokyo ' s strong organization .
after emperor konin was enthroned ( succeeding to empress shotoku ) , chokushisho kept functioning as a procurement office , though the size was reduced .
** fujiwara no tadamaro was the only chokushisho official whose name appears in a record : he served as chokushi-kyo and died in 000 during his service .
** later , kurodo dokoro ( board of archivists ) was established and took over the chokushisho .
this organization is considered to have imitated shibi chudai , which transmitted orders from empress dowager komyo .
** tenjobito/uebito ( a high-ranking courtier allowed into the imperial palace )
** tenjobito/uebito was a court official of fifth rank or above in japanese pre-modern government organization and permitted to enter the emperor ' s private living quarters , i . e . , the south side of the emperor ' s residence seiryoden .
** tenjobito had their names registered in the court roster called ' senseki ' , which also meant tenjobito .
tenjobito was ordered to undertake the night duty in the imperial palace in exchange for the permission to enter the emperor ' s residence .
tenjobito included those who were permitted to enter the retired emperor ' s residence and the crown prince ' s residence .
later , tenjobito began to mean those who were permitted to wait on the emperor as trusted vessel ; whichever the meaning , the privilege was untransferable and only effective until the emperor , the retired emperor or the crown prince changed .
therefore , when the privilege ended , the nobles needed to have the imperial permission anew to enter the emperor ' s residence .
** saiguryo ( the office of the high priestess [of the ise-jingu shrine] )
** summary and duties
** history
** the remains of saiku designated as a historic site
** address of the remains of saiku
** saiguryo was an extra statutory office established under the ritsuryo system , placed in ise province .
** saiguryo looked after the dairy life of maiden imperial princesses saigu ( ise saio ) , who served as priestesses of the ise-jingu shrine .
saigu lived in the innermost house of the saiguryo office , which was placed in taki county in ise province .
saiguryo was divided into three areas : the innermost area was saigu ' s residence ; the middle area was the residence of the head and other leading members ; and the outer area was the residence and working place of the lower-level officials .
the remains of saiguryo is designated a national historic site as ' saiku ato ' ( the remains of saiku ) .

** cavalry
** japanese cavalry
** cavalry was a military force formed by soldiers mounting on horseback , armed with swords , spears , and guns .
mounted soldiers had the advantages of high speed and great impact over their opponents on foot .
** in the medieval ｐeriod , only a person of high rank ( samurai or knight ) was able to join cavalry .
today , it almost lost its original function and became one of the features of ceremony .
the police cavalry often patrol the city even now .
( in england and other countries )
** history
until the emergence of ashigaru ( foot soldiers ) as combat personnel , it was generally accepted that official battles were basically conducted only by cavalry of samurai groups .
** after the sengoku period ( japan ) , when ashigaru began to be recognized as a new fighting force , the military system of sengoku daimyo ( japanese territorial lord in the sengoku peiord ) shifted to that in which defense was regarded as a fundamental .
under these circumstances , the main duty of the cavalry as a defense force was to break through the front-line of ashigaru troops or to launch counterattacks against the opponent ' s ashigaru troops .
cavalry deployed for a defence force unit was composed of twenty to fifty horsemen ; each horseman received an annual stipend of about 000 to 000 koku .
** cavalry operations
** the style of a body-armor also shifted from oyoroi ( heavy armor ) to haramaki ( a breast protection ) ; a shallow saddle was more used than a deep one .
when the sengoku period started , spears introduced around the same time became the main weapon used by mounted warriors , and also listed as must-have items for a military service .
** ( it does not mean that nobody used a japanese sword as a main weapon . )
** initially , mounted warriors in the sengoku period seemed to rush at the enemy ' s position by riding on horseback .
( for that occasion , young samurai , who followed close behind mounted warriors , probably caught up with them easily because the distance to the enemy was only 000 meters in consideration of shooting range of a matchlock gun . )
however , with the increase of ashigaru and the emergence of its military strategy against cavalry , rushing at the enemy ' s position on foot by dismounting from the horse became common first in the western part of japan , and later throughout the country .
( aming at horses was considered very important in both yaribusuma [a line of long spears held ready to attack] and shooting by musket troops against mounted warriors . )
** genjina
** summary
** the genjina ( professional names ) are nomenclature named after the classic book genji monogatari ( the tale of genji ) .
** the genjina is a professional name that is assumed by or given to women and the practice owes its origins to the classic book genji monogatari .
from the middle ages at first through to recent times such names were used by ladies at court who served the nobility .
however , subsequently the genjina were apparently used by waiting maids of samurai family .
the earliest use of ' genjina ' that can be validated is the name which appears in the book " sanetaka koki " ( the journal of sanetaka sanjonishi ) .
umegae ' ( died december 00 , 0000 ) was the genjina of a woman who served as a maid servant to sanetaka sanjonishi .
there were conditions associated with assuming a genjina as follows :
** in the strictest sense , the names were limited to the 00 chapter titles of genji monogatari .
** in addition to this strict sense of meaning can be added the names of protagonists appearing in the genji monogatari .
** in a broader sense , genjina could be interpreted to mean names that bear no direct relationship with genji monogatari however , are names that are reminiscent of the grace that is encapsulated by the genji monogatari .
** initially in the bygone heian period there was a custom that prostitutes assumed elegant names .
in the edo period genjina were used by prostitutes in the red light districts ( at which stage the " genjina " bore no relationship with the previous usage and there was a proliferation of such names ) .
moreover , from that point onwards the names lost all sense of linkage with the genji monogatari once workers in the bar and nightlife industry called themselves by such names in the workplace and now it bacame tradition .
** kihei taishogun ( commander of cavalry )
** kihei taishogun was a military official established in the nara period under the ritsuryo system .
kihei taishogun was a commander to head cavalrymen who were conscripted throughout japan , and led the cavalry to escort and dignify the entrance of foreign envoy or imperial visit .
it is also called ' kiheishi ' .
** summary
** when emperor shotoku visited yuge , kawachi province in 000 , fujiwara no tadamaro and kyofuku kudaranokonikishi were appointed respective kihei taishogun .
** jigenin/shimobito ( government official who were not allowed to see the emperor )
** jigenin ' or ' shimobito ' is one of the statuses of aristocrats in japan .
jigenin can also be called simply ' jige . '
jigenin was a court official who was not given imperial sanction to access to the imperial court .
later , samurai warriors and commoners of the corresponding status were also called jigenin .
even the families which were conferred upon the title of the peerage such as count or viscount after the meiji period were called jigenin if they were not originally court nobles .
** jigenin of fourth or fifth rank was called ' shodaibu ( masters ) of jige ' .
** when the family ranks were gradually defined after the middle ages , the families were clearly divided without regard to the official ranks : toshoke , the families permitted to enter the imperial palace ; and jigeke , the families held the status of jigenin .
** yonin ( steward )
** summary
** yonin was a member of the organization that formed part of a samurai family during the edo period .
the yonin handled feudal related matters on behalf of the whole samurai family and , was the key figure responsible for administering a broad range of matters .
as such , it was common to select a capable individual for the role of yonin .
it is also known as goyonin .
** yonin were also known to be called soba-yonin ( adjutant steward ) , ko-yonin ( assistants of daimyo ( feudal lords ) and komyo ( minor feudal lords ) ) , hiroshiki-yonin ( daimyo ' s wife ' s steward or , key steward in a merchant household ) .
however , in a broader sense , the role of yonin included all the above roles however , in this text the yonin meaning is interpreted in a narrow sense .
** the yonin role was mainly responsible for taking care of the lord ' s affairs .
however , the role soba-yonin refers to the individual mainly responsible for dealing with a lord ' s domain and senior vassals .
the soba-yonin is said to have mainly handled the lord ' s ' general business including private and political affairs ' and , dealings with others .
on the other hand , the yonin was mainly responsible for keeping the lord informed of ' official matters ' within the domain and family and , handling general negotiations and dealings with other parties .
he yojin had to be careful as the person who actually informed the lord of matters within the domain and his family was not the yojin themselves .
** at the beginning of the edo period , it was not unusual for domains not to have an established yonin role .
however , with the coming of peace , yonin that were responsible for office clerical and related roles were appeared in place in various provinces across japan .
in larger domains , the role of yonin could not be said to be chief retainer but , was a role that handled business , dealing and general affairs for the lord and elders of the domain .
in the smaller domains , the yonin was second to the elders as chief retainers and , it was common to provide the elders with a whole range of assistance .
at times , there were occasions when the yonin made their own decisions .
** in many provinces the yojin were senior vassals who were permitted to ride on horseback .
also , in many provinces where the yojin worked as highly paid senior vassals , those vassals engaged retainers themselves to act as their own yojin .
** however with the exception of the high ranking families and alternative arrangements , as a general rule as vassals of the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , yonin were not provided for family elders and the elderly within families .
in many provinces it was customary for yojin to be treated the same as senior vassals and on a par with family elders .
as vassals of the shogun , the role of yonin had a high ranking cachet .
for example , it was common for 000 koku ( 0000 bushel ) vassals to be allowed one yonin .
** kokumo/kokubo ( imperial mother )
** kokumo ( or kokubo ) is the title for real mothers of emperors or kings .
** fujiwara no senshi , the real mother of emperor ichijo , became a nun and entitled higashi sanjoin , which set a precedent for kokumo and junbo to become nun and then entitled nyoin ( a close female relative of the emperor or a woman of comparable standing ) .
at later times , there were cases of exception where the title nyoin was given to kokumo or junbo who did not become a nun , or even to those who were not kokumo or junbo .
** after the meiji restoration , the title of kokumo has not been used .
** hikan ( low ranking clerks )
** who were hikan ?
** under the ritsuryo system ( administrative and legal system adopted by japan from china in the seventh and eighth century ) the term " hikan " referred to clerks who were attached to low ranked officials who in turn were attached to senior officials .
the hikan ( low ranking clerks ) were attached to bureaus within the eight ministries that existed under the ritsuryo system and , were also attached to offices , sections and village offices in the provinces .
( opposed to shokan ( local officials ) )
** the term " shokan " refers to samurai who were subordinate ( i . e . of lower rank ) to high ranking samurai .
shokan were mainly provincial lords who were subordinate to the shugo ( provincial governor ) .
** from the edo period onwards , the term referred to peasants who were affiliated to a landlord .
** shugo daimyo ( shugo , which were japanese provincial military governors , that became daimyo , which were japanese feudal lords ) and the hikan
hikan were also initially called hihan-nin .
they indicated the concept of those lower ranked bureaucrats attached to senior level bureaucrats .
this changed from the muromachi period following the appropriation of police powers by shugo where during the kamakura period where a shift took place whereby local provincial lords became affiliated with daimyo as shugo daimyo .
with this , the term " hikan " was also used to generally refer to the status of the populace of a province who were subordinate to the shugo .
also besides this , provincial feudal lords along with shoke ( households not part of the family of the direct lineage chief ) , local clans and provincial samurai , influential peasants were also in certain cases considered to be hikan .
the term was also used to refer to the general concept of those who were somewhat subordinate but not satisfying a fully independent master-servant relationship .
** these were different to the true vassals of a governor .
** in amongst these , were governors from governors ' families who served as daikan ( provincial magistrate governors ) or shugodai ( military governors ) .
in cases where the governor vassals , there were lower ranked vassals who under pressure from the governor family were pressed into paying tributes .
** when fellow shugo battled each other , the hikan or regional folk and regional lords had a great influence on events .
as such , when looking at cases where the hikan contributed to a victory , there is no lack of examples where the fortunes of battle shifted because of betrayals to hostile forces .
** in this way , the hikan held a degree of influence stemming from autonomous self independence .
there were more than a few regional lords who lost both status and the autonomy .
on the other hand , as in the case of the mori clan , there were examples of provincial folk who were subordinates of governors who managed to overcome the power of the shugo and shugodai and gained prominence as sengoku daimyo .
most hikan had to decided which power they should comply with , or how to keep their independent existence .
the rule of force reigned and toyed with the fortunes of the hikan common folk .
** in spite of this , throughout the sengoku period there were hikan common folk who maintained an independent existence .
however , from around those times onwards , hikan were absorbed into the ranks of vassals of the bakufu or daimyo ( with the exception of individuals who had gained status of sengoku daimyo or a more recent daimyo military lord ) .

generally , these roles were inherited by the selected influential town chiefs , and their salaries called ' yakugin ' and the maintenance costs of the machidai room were charged to the towns .
** to counter the trend , the kyoto city magistrates managed to keep the class system and the kyoto citizens had antipathy toward machidai , who had become the ruler ' s proxy--machidai caught between these two sides .

** seven generals
** attack on mitsunari ishida
** the seven generals ( or " nanasho " ) are the feudal lords who were reared by hideyoshi toyotomi from an early age and famous as the brave generals .
** masanori fukushima ( lord of kiyosu-jo castle in owari province )
** kiyomasa kato ( lord of kumamoto-jo castle in higo province )
** terumasa ikeda ( lord of yoshida-jo castle in mikawa province )
** tadaoki hosokawa ( lord of miyazu-jo castle in tango province )
** yoshinaga asano ( lord of kofu-jo castle in kai province )

** these are the seven generals .
** some sources include iemasa hachisuka ( lord of tokushima-jo castle in awa province ) and takatora todo ( lord of uwajima-jo castle in iyo province ) .
** april 00 , 0000
without any mediator , the feud between the two factions turned violent .
** the seven generals , with long-harbored resentment , schemed to defeat mitsunari by heading their armies to kiyomasa kato ' s residence near the osaka-jo castle and attack mitsunari together .
mitsunari perceived their scheme and fled with his chief vassal kiyooki shima ( also known as sakon shima ) to the residence of his ally yoshinobu satake ( ukyo no daibu ) .
** having noticed that mitsunari had fled , the seven generals started to raid each one of the feudal lords ' residences near the osaka-jo castle , and the army of kato headed for satake ' s residence .
** now , mitsunari decided to take refuge in the residence of his political opponent ieyasu tokugawa in fushimi .
** ieyasu flatly rejected the request by the seven generals in the next morning to extradite mitsunari , saying ' over my dead body ' .
ieyasu forced mitsunari to promise to retire in exchange for being saved from extradition , and had his second son hideyasu yuki send mitsunari to his home caste , sawayama-jo caste .
** all the seven generals took the leading role in the eastern army in the battle of sekigahara , which broke out about one and half years later .
** naijusho ( ministry of royal pages )
** summary
** naijusho was an extra statutory office established in the latter half of the nara period under the ritsuryo system .
naijusho controlled over the naiju officials who attended the emperor and the female attendants , while guarded the imperial palace .
** naiju ' originally meant the middle and low ranked court officials and government officials who were in charge of miscellaneous affairs and guard in the imperial palace , which were gradually organized into a leading agency ' naijusho ' ( 内豎所 ) to be established .
** on august 00 , 000 , naijusho was established to expand the duties of the naijudokoro ( royal pages office ) .
** gokenin ( an immediate vassal of the shogunate ) in kyoto
** a gokenin in kyoto is also referred to as zaikyonin .
however , they were often excluded from kyoto obanyaku ( a job to guard kyoto ) because the job was a shift work only for a short period of time .
** a gokenin in kyoto in the early days referred mainly to the ones who owned a shoryo ( territory ) in saigoku ( western part of japan ( [especially kyushu , but ranging as far east as kinki] ) .
but there were also gokenin sent from togoku ( the eastern part of japan , particularly kanto region ) .
they served under the command of the kamakura bakufu in principle .
however , the right to judge criminal cases used by the bakufu at that time was based on the approval given by the imperial court .
therefore , they could not refuse any command given by the imperial court which was superior to the bakufu in rank .
( for that reason ) , they also worked as guards , etc . by the commands of the imperial court .
the retired emperor gotoba took advantage of these circumstances to appoint gokenin in kyoto to kebiishi ( officials with judicial and police powers ) or government official ( especially one of low to medium rank ) to be efu ( a palace guard ) .
he often gave shoryo to them or added them in the hokumen no bushi ( the imperial palace guards for the north side ) or the saimen no bushi ( the imperial palace guards for the west side ) in his own right .
the same was true of kyoto-shugo ( military governor of kyoto ) who was the representative of the kamakura bakufu in kyoto .
the kyoto-shugo was chosen from among the pro-bakufu court nobles , except for a certain period of time .
the gokenin in kyoto began to be strongly influenced by the imperial court which was before their eyes , rather than the kamakura bakufu ,
accordingly , many of them took the side with the retired emperor gotoba in the jokyu war then lost their power .
** as rokuhara tandai ( an administrative and judicial agency in rokuhara , kyoto ) was founded after the war , the system of gokenin in kyoto was reconstructed under its control .
the bakufu assigned gokenin in kyoto who remained loyal to it during the war to keep their position and shoryo , and those who moved to saigoku after given shoryo there after the war , to rokuhara tandai .
they came to be engaged in military and security activities under the command of rokuhara tandai .
they were exempted from duties such as obanyaku ( a job to guard kyoto ) in exchange for being permanently stationed in kyoto .
later kagariya ( a guardhouse for soldiers placed at street corners in kyoto and kamakura during the kamakura period ) were built in kyoto .
gokenin in kyoto took charge of maintaining the security of the city as kagariya guards in exchange for receiving a shoryo called kagariya ryosho ( a granted estate for kagariya guarding service ) as a benefit .
therefore , they came to be also called kagariya gokenin .
** the burden on the gokenin in kyoto became heavier and heavier .
in addition , miuchibito ( private vassals of the tokuso ) sent to rokuhara tandai came to supervise the gokenin in kyoto .
the confrontation with gokenin in kyoto who offended it became worse .
most of the samurai who eventually went down with rokuhara tandai , in the assault on it by takauji ashikaga on the eve of the fall of the kamakura bakufu , were the members of the hojo clan and miuchibito .
only few gokenin in kyoto were included among them because many gokenin switched to the ashikaga side or withdrew from the front after judging the movement of takauji .
gokenin who survived it were reorganized into hokoshu ( a military post in muromachi shogunate ) , etc . under the jurisdiction of the muromachi bakufu .
** major gokenin in kyoto in the early days :

** junsatsushi ( a circuit-riding inspector or investigating commissioner ) ( china )
** summary
** junsatsushi ( a circuit-riding inspector or investigating commissioner ) was a government official title which originated in the tang dynasty of china .
the junsatsushi was later given alternative names , such as ' azechi ' and ' anbushi . '
** for the most part ' gyoshi ' ( imperial censors ) were appointed junsatsushi , but neither its title nor its personnel was fixed .
** thereafter , many examples of junsatsushi can be seen until circa 000 .
** saiho shochishi ( an investigating commissioner )
** summary
** saiho shochishi ( an investigating commissioner ) was a title of the government official in tang dynasty of china .
** in 000 , the empire under the tang dynasty , which had previously been divided into 00 administrative regions called ' dao ' circuits of inspection , was redivided into 00 dao circuits , each of which had a ' saiho shochishi ' stationed .
prior to the redividing of the circuits in 000 , when 00 circuits were divided in the reign of the emperor jungjong ( tang ) , ' junsatsushi ' ( a circuit-riding inspector or investigating commissioner ) had been stationed in each circuit .
** the official duties of saiho shochishi corresponded to those of ' shu shishi ' ( provincial governors ) in the han dynasty .
accordingly , a ' keikido saihoshi ' ( a jingji circuit investigating commissioner ) corresponded to a colonel director of retainers which was called ' sili xiaowei ' ( garrison the capital of the executive ) in the han dynasty .
** each saiho shochishi was stationed in the most important province among all the provinces within his jurisdiction .
later , the official duties of saiho shochishi began to shift gradually to civil administration .
during and after the reign of the emperor suzong ( tang ) , the ' saiho shochishi ' was renamed as ' kansatsushi ' ( an imperial inspector ) , and the empire was divided into 00 or more dao circuits .
accordingly , the jurisdiction of each inspector extended over more than 00 provinces in the case of a large circuit , and 0 or 0 provinces in the case of a small circuit .
** setsudoshi ' ( a military commissioner in charge of a dao circuit ) exercised greater power than ' kansatsushi ' ( imperial inspector ) , being a military officer by nature who was assigned the additional civilian post of ' kansatsushi ' ( imperial inspector ) .
** kuge-ryo ( the land and land rights of the court nobles called the kuge )
** summary
** in ancient japan
** in early medieval japan
** in later medieval japan
** in early modern japan
** in a wider context the term ' kuge-ryo ' can include the estate of the imperial household .
** the stipend system according to the ritsuryo law , however , collapsed at an early stage , and the nobles attempted to develop their own infrastructures , involving ' guji ' ( chief priests of shinto shrines ) .
already in the nara period , dominating nobles occupied the countryside and established their own territories by privatizing reclaimed lands in accordance with the act for the privatization of reclaimed lands in perpetuity .
it was in the 00th century when the system to undertake an actual tax collection by kokushi ( provincial governors ) was established , and accordingly , imperial households , high court nobles and guji financially depended upon ' shinno ' ( gifts ) from the kokushi .
those zuryo and zaichokanjin ( local officials ) consolidated their positions as shokan ( an officer governing shoen manor ) by voluntarily donating shoen manors which they had created to influential magnates .
moreover , people who were personally subordinated to the imperial and the sekkan-ke families were granted kyumenden ( tax free rice fields provided as salary ) , thereby becoming kugonin ( purveyors to the imperial household ) and thus creating shoen manors .
** it was very different between the sekkan-ke families and the seiga-ke families ( the second highest family status for court nobles ) as to how they administered an estate ( for instance , administration of the imperial estate was close to that of the sekkan-ke family . )
in addition to the watari-ryo , the gosekke families possessed their own private estates which were called keryo ( the original ancestral holding of a family ) .
( this applied to some kuge whose class were lower that of the seiga-ke families , but the control of estate affairs was even harder for them without funds and political power . )
even so , some of the kuge possessed chigyo koku ( provincial fiefdom ) and its succession was hereditary ( e . g . the nakanoin family of the kozuke province , the saionji family of the iyo province , and the like ) .
the shoryo ( fief ) of the kuge of a middle and lower class was largely classified into two kinds : ' soden ' ( hereditary succession ) and ' onryo ' ( rewarded land ) .
therefore , a conflict occasionally arose between the honke ( the imperial and sekkan-ke families ) and the ryoke ( the kuge of a middle and lower class ) as to whether an individual kuge-ryo territory was a soden or an onryo .
** it was impossible , however , to resist the kuge administration which was maintained by the military force of the muromachi bakufu .
note that the question of which authority , the emperor or the shogun , took the initiative with regard to the ' ando ' authorization depended on the period of time .
** the two prominent sengoku daimyo , nobunaga oda and hideyoshi toyotomi , guaranteed ( ' ando ' ) the remaining landholding ( ' shoryo ' ) of the kuge nobles and provided them with new fiefs ( ' chigyo ' ) .
incidentally , in the middle of the edo period , the sum of the size of the landholdings of the miyake and kuge , 000 families in total , was 00 , 000 koku .
except for a few families , however , the okata was merely granted fief ( ' chigyo ' ) which was as little as the low stipend ( ' sho rokudaka ' ) samurai , and therefore , they had to endure poverty .
** genji shoguns
** who were the genji shoguns ?
** at the time sanetomo was serving as shogun , tomomasa hiraga ( who was a minamoto clan ) was providing backing for the removal of sanetomo and replacement with tokimasa hojo .
** genji shoguns ( warrior generals ) were the minamoto clan members given the responsibility of seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) .
in particular , it is said he was a shogun ( general ) who hailed from the seiwa-genji ( minamoto clan ) .
** in a narrow sense , the genji shoguns are identified as three generations of shoguns that commenced with minamoto no yoritomo ( who set up the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ) , minamoto no yoriie and minamoto no sanetomo .
in a broader sense , seii taishogun who preceded yoritomo can be included : minamoto no yoshinaka and the founder of the muromachi bakufu of the same kawachi-genji ( minamoto clan ) .
also included is takauji ashikaga , the patriarch of the ashikaga shogun family line .
also supposedly laying claim to the minamoto clan line is the family of tokugawa shoguns who established the edo bakufu .
** at the layman ' s level , a myth about genji shogun that being minamoto clan was required to assume the position of seii taishogun .
however , initially no such requirement existed .
of course , there are those amongst the ashikaga and tokugawa shogun families and so on that took to using the minamoto clan as part of their name and , their relatives ' monopolized aspects of government service on a hereditary basis .
looking back further still to the heian period , in the timeframe following otomo no otomaro and sakanoue no tamuramaro ' s duties as seii taishogun , taking on the role of seii taishogun was not limited to the minamoto clan .
by contrast , until yoritomo cousin minamoto no yoshinaka assumed the mantle of seii taishogun , the minamoto clan had no claim at all to the title of seii taishogun .
this was because in the first instance , the role was assumed by chinju-fu ( pacification and defense headquarters ) and chinju-fu shogun ( commander-in-chief of the defense of the north ) both located in mutsu province .
from around the middle of the heian period , role of seii taishogun was held as a matter of course by this individual .
furthermore , the appointment of yoshinaka as the initial seiwa-genji ' s seii taishogun was unprecedented as yoshinaka was initially overlooked for the role .
it goes without saying therefore , key samurai families with pedigree are not limited to the minamoto clan .
whichever historical period is reviewed , it is not inevitable that to be shogun one had to be a minamoto clan .
** what is certain is , the seiwa-genji was representative of the minamoto samurai family .
from a standpoint of amalgamating the samurai forces in the eastern provinces , they were proud of their efforts and having been the family to overwhelm other samurai families .
members of the seiwa-genji and in particular yoritomo ' s kawachi-genji clan were held in high regard for their bravery ( along with minamoto no yoshiie ) .
as a leading samurai military family , the leaders of the minamoto clan and its line of eldest sons was the family lineage that managed to unify and amalgamate the forces of the samurai of the eastern provinces .
** for a brief period of time , the minamoto clan were commanded by imperial order to pursue the enemy taira family ( who had seized real power from the imperial court ) and subsequently ordered to hunt down and kill the taira family .
receiving these commands , the minamoto clan mobilized its army again but , samurai military government powers were established when the minamoto clan would not take orders from the imperial court ensconced in the eastern provinces .
it is thought this outcome is proof positive that the social standing of the minamoto clan as the supreme military family presence was forged .
** subsequently , it appears he was welcomed as a miyashogun ( shogun from the imperial court ) from the imperial families , so the precedent that one could not become a shogun unless of the minamoto clan stock was overturned at the behest of the kamakura bakufu itself .
however , yoritomo was treated as an outsider ( even though he came from the same family in the seiwa-genji ) and , was ruined due to doubts about his allegiances .
of course , there are absolutely no doubts that it was commonly thought that minamoto clan members should be shoguns as it was they who had marshaled the collective power of japan ' s samurai .
** upon his return to kamakura , there were also discussions about him changing his name to minamoto clan .
** this was because the view that the leader of the bakufu had to be a minamoto ( genji ) shogun was deeply rooted amongst lower ranked vassals at that time .
however , at the time the real power of the bakufu was held in the hands of the shogun ' s regents , the hojo clan .
the shogun ' s position to be precise was no more than as a puppet or symbolic figurehead .
from the hojo clan ' s viewpoint , they wished to offset a situation where cohesive unifying power were held by the minamoto clan .
in fact , besides imperial prince koreyasu received the title of imperial prince by imperial order from status of a subject , he was also removed from being shogun .
koreyasu ' s male cousin imperial prince hisaaki ( imperial prince of emperor gofukakusa ) was a very young child when he assumed the position of shogun .
furthermore , there was no demotion from nobility to subject and , imperial prince morikuni , who also received backing to become a shogun as a miyashogun .
** process of revival of the genji shoguns and creation of genji shogun legends
in 0000 the kamakura bakufu collapsed and emperor godaigo moved towards setting up a new kenmu administration amongst a escalating disturbances across japan .
with this in mind as well , the seiwa-genji also looked towards a genji shogun of the ilk of minamoto no yoritomo .
takauji ashikaga who also shared kawachi-genji origins backed the northern dynasty and , served as seii taishogun at the opening of the muromachi bakufu that went on to see a revival in the genji shoguns for around the next 000 years .
whereupon , takauji ashikaga stated more or less as follows .
initially for generations seii taishogun was a fellow genpei ( minamoto clan and taira clan ) clansman but that status has no bearing . '
this matter at hand in places has deep significance on the profound wishes of imperial court and , the families . '
in other words , in relation to the countless examples of members of the minamoto and taira clans serving as seii taishogun , and besides being the recipient of shogun proclamations , he wished to report to the emperor that the hojo clan had been subjugated .
dismissing these wishes , takauji ashikaga took it upon himself to raise an army to suppress the hojo clan .
without notifying the imperial court , in order to make plans to subjugate samurai families in various provinces , it was made to look as if the subjugation drive emanated from the imperial court .
with fresh backing from the northern dynasty and serving as seii taishogun , he established muromachi bakufu and revived the genji shogun .
the house of ashikaga shogun families was the same as what was previously the house of genji shoguns .
however , the muromachi bakufu was substantially destroyed during the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
it therefore can not be justified to say only minamoto clan were allowed to be shogun as there were limitations to a genji shogun obtaining any role they happened to desire .
however , nobunaga ' s successor , hideyoshi toyotomi managed to unify the whole country and also sought the role of shogun .
it is said that hideyoshi took it upon himself to dismiss requests from yoshiaki ashikaga , 00th generation of shogun in the muromachi bakufu , to adopt hideyoshi as his child .

** shogun in the japanese medieval period
** shogun in modern japanese history
** shogun in premodern china
** shogun as title of respect for sovereigns
** other
** shogun is a job grade and title given to the commander of a relatively large armed force and is also the rank of a military clique leader .
as title , it is also called shogun-go ( title of general ) .
it has been the title of the military commander in the orient since ancient times .
in diplomatic situations and inside the armed forces , the commander is addressed as " kakka " ( your excellency ) .
** origin of the word
** the word " shogun " originated in china and meant , as the characters represent , " to lead an army , " which was adopted as official position or title of the commander leading the armed forces .
use of the term dates back as early as the chunqui period in china .
later , it came into use as the rank of an army commander to replace the word sima ( grand marshal ? ) .
in the han dynasty , the position of shogun was temporary and given to officials on an ad hoc basis .
** above these ranks is the general of the army ( general of the army in the case of the us ) .
however , these top military officers from brigadier general to general and the general of the army are addressed and referred to as " generals . "
the word " shogun " is used as the japanese translation of " general " is used to address these military officers .
specifically , a senior military officer in any of these ranks named xxxx will be described as general xxxx .
in the case of douglas macarthur , for example , he was officially general of the army , but would often be called " gensui " in japanese .
in english , he is addressed as general macarthur , a title that is translated as " shogun " in japanese .
( however , this case applies to the us armed forces only , and the title marshal is used to refer to " gensui " in european nations .
in these countries , senior officers from general to brigadier general are addressed as " general , " but " marshal " is used separately as a title for the " gensui " only .
** in japan , all ranks and titles in other countries that correspond to " general " are called " shogun . "
for further details , refer to the list of titles by military rank .
** an example is heihachiro togo , who should be addressed as " admiral togo " but is at times described as " general togo . "
** in japan , the title has been in used since the ages described in the nihon shoki ( chronicles of japan ) .
the first mention may be the shido-shogun ( generals dispatched to the four circuits ) who served emperor sujin .
in the history of east asia , there is record of waobu ( the last king of ancient japan ) being appointed king and grand general of japan by china .
it must be noted here that the native japanese reading for 将軍 is " ikusa-no-kami . "
** in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) , the role of the shogun is defined in article 00 of the gunboryo ( the statute on military defense ) .
according to the article , an army of more than 00 , 000 requires a shogun and two vice-shoguns as commanders .
also , a daishogun ( commander-in-chief ) is to be appointed for every three armies .
however , actual appointments were not based on the size of the army , and the appointment of a number of shoguns under the daishogun was never practiced .
each general carried different title descriptions , and none of them were known only as " general . "
the only permanent rank was commander-in-chief of defense ( later chinju-fu shogun or commander-in-chief of defense of the north ) in charge of defense against the ezo .
** under the kamakura bakufu , the only shogun title was seii taishogun ( barbarian subduing generalissimo ) , making shogun the abbreviated name for this rank .
with shogunate rule gaining stability , the function of the chinju-fu shogun was in effect absorbed into the authority of the seii taishogun , which continued to the downfall of the kamakura bakufu .
** the chinju-fu shogun title was restored during the period of the northern and southern courts .
chikafusa kitabatake of the southern court requested on the appointment of his son akiie kitabatake as mutsu no kami and chinju-fu shogun that a shogun ranking higher than sanmi ( third rank ) be granted to chinju daishogun .
it has been recorded that akiie became chinju daishogun after this .
** in the period after the muromachi bakufu to the edo bakufu , shogun was regarded synonymous with seii taishogun because the seii taishogun was the only shogun title .
however , it was not strictly a title for a military commander , but reflected a position of political power similar to the prime minister of today .
for this reason , a sense of discrepancy grew from calling the top leader a shogun .
this led to the use of titles such as kubo-sama , gosho-sama and uesama ( used variably depending on the period of history ) when referring to the ruler .
as a diplomatic title , there are cases of the ruler being called the king of japan or tycoon of japan .
a retired ruler is called ogosho .
** however , the fifteenth shogun yoshinobu tokugawa of the edo bakufu implemented taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) in 0000 .
later , the meiji government abolished the title of seii taishogun and the shogunate system .
for this reason , the tokugawa family was the last to hold the title of shogun .
** shogun borrowed by western languages point exclusively to seii taishogun of japan .
also , " shogun " is a novel by james clavell , on which a film and a tv drama series have been produced .
** in the age of the han dynasty , the shogun was a rank granted to the military commander by the emperor when such a leader was necessary , and the topmost commander-in-chief was regarded equivalent to the san gong ( three dukes ) .
under the commander-in chief are the general of the cavalry , general of the guards , and general of the cavalry and chariots , who were in turn served by jo-shogun ( grand general ) , general of the hidden waves and others who served on temporary basis .
subsequent wars led to increase in the number of shogun titles , and there were 000 titles for twelve organizations when sho en ( xiao yan ) of liang ( southern court ) of the southern dynasty systematized the titles .
in the tang dynasty , there were shogun titles for bureacratic rank and also for imperial busankan rank .
in the northern sung dynasty , only the title of busankan remained , but later disappeared in the shenzong dynasty , when it was renamed taifu and ro .
the title was revived and conferred to the busankan rank during the yuan dynasty and also as title for the military commander in chief and the subordinate commanders in the ming dynasty that followed .
** however , the title in some cases had been used as part of a strategy to enhance the image of the person in power in a nation that is generally perceived to be a dictatorship .
** also , manuel noriega of panama , saddam hussein of iraq and kim il song and son kim jong il of the democratic people ' s republic of korea were called " shogun . "
** for this reason , the term is commonly used in the two countries after titles such as company president , department chief , teacher , etc .
the " nim " after the shogun title for kim jong il therefore is used as an application of this custom and is not used exclusively for the leader .

** roju ( member of shogun ' s council of elders )
** history
** roju in domains
** roju was a post in the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and domains in the edo period .
roju was a permanent post placed immediately under shogun to control the national administration , and was not a fixed name for the post .
the name originated in toshiyori ( literally , old persons ) , which was an important post in the tokugawa clan when the tokugawa family was a daimyo , and the use of roju for the post was established in around the kanei era ( 0000 - 0000 ) .
in domains , karo ( the chief retainer ) was sometimes called roju .
** in the edo bakufu , the post of rokuninshu ( literally , six persons ; corresponding to the later wakadoshiyori ( literally , younger old persons ) post ) was established in 0000 , and was abolished in 0000 , with the job absorbed in that of roju .
however , in 0000 , the wakadoshiyori post was again established for housekeeping of the shogun family , sharing the job with roju .
in " tokugawa jikki " ( a collection of official records of the edo bakufu ) , roju was also recorded as shukuro ( literally , experienced old persons ) .
initially , roju was called toshiyorishu ( literally , old persons ) , and the name of toshiyorishu was generally used among hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu , which was a form of japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
** the number of roju was four to five , and one of them was in charge of daily affairs in monthly rotation .
the room called goyoubeya , placed in the honmaru-goten palace of the edo castle , was used as their office , and for important matters , they met there and conferred together .
actually , the roju other than the one in charge for the month also conferred on and dealt with important matters .
in 0000 , one of the roju was assigned a job specialized in financial affairs as katte-gakari ( literally , kitchen-handling ) roju .
this roju was also called roju-shuza ( head roju ) and administered the affairs of the state as the chief of roju . .
in addition , nishinomaru roju ( roju at the western compound ) was sometimes placed .
nishinomaru roju was not engaged in the affairs of the bakufu but was solely responsible for housekeeping of ogosho ( leading or influential figure ) or the heir of shogun who resided in nishinomaru .
** it was specified that ordinarily a roju had to be fudai daimyo ( a daimyo who had belonged to the tokugawa group before the battle of sekigahara ) with 00 , 000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) rice yields .
however , there were exceptions , and some daimyo with less then 00 , 000 koku rice yields became roju from the roju-kaku post ( a post at the roju level ) .
most roju came from posts under the immediate control of shogun , such as sobayonin ( lord chamberlain ) , kyoto-shoshidai ( the kyoto deputy ) , and osaka-jodai ( the person sent for administering the osaka castle ) .
** it was custom that the rank of the daimyo who was appointed to osaka-jodai was promoted to jushiinoge ( junior fourth rank , lower grade ) from jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) .
furthermore , it was also custom that , when a person was appointed to kyoto-shoshidai or roju , the rank of the person was raised to jushiinoge and jiju ( a chamberlain ) .
a person whose rank was jushiinoge or higher was allowed to have an audience with emperor .
** when a roju had an official title ( for example , xx kami or xx taifu ) , use of the same title by other persons was voluntarily avoided .
when a roju talked to another roju , the name and title ' xx dono , ' with the official name inserted into them , was used .
** it is said that their working hours were around four hours .
ordinarily , roju came to the edo castle at around 00 am and left there at around 0 pm .
** roju resided mostly around the nishinomaru ( the western compound of the edo castle ) ( the present outer garden of the imperial palace ) .
** in domains , the post which was equivalent to karo ( the chief retainer ) was sometimes called roju .
for example , when it is found that ' roju ' was written in an application form , it is necessary to conduct historical investigations to determine whether it indicated karo under a lord or roju at the bakufu .
** wakadoshiyori
** what is wakadoshiyori ?
** it was a post in the edo bakufu government .
its details are described in a main paragraph .
** the post with the same title was placed at domains as well as at the bakufu .
** this term is also used for indicating a male who looks older than his real age .
** while roju were in charge of national affairs , wakadoshiyori were responsible for housekeeping of the shogun family and mainly controlling hatamoto ( direct retainers of shogun ) and gokenin ( also direct retainers of shogun , but generally speaking , lower-ranked than hatamoto ) .
** however , because four of them were promoted to roju and consequently the meaning of the existence of the post was lost , the rokuninshu post was abolished once , with its jobs were absorbed in roju .
later , the post was restored as the wakatoshiyori post .
the number of the wakatoshiyori members was roughly four , and the post became a step for roju or sobayonin ( lord chamberlain ) .
** tairo ( chief minister )
** summary
** the four families that assumed the tairo post
** the sakai family
** the doi family
** the hotta family
** a list of the persons who assumed the tairo post
** summary of tairo in domains
** tairo was the highest post in the edo bakufu government system , provisionally placed above roju as an assistant to shogun .
in a broad sense , this term was used for indicating the highest responsible persons in a daimyo family or in an administrative body ( gotairo [council of five elders] in the toyotomi government were well known ) .
** it was not a permanent post , and the number of its members was ordinarily one .
tairo was involved only in important policy decisions ( called taisei-sanyo ) , and was exempted from doing daily jobs , such as commuting to hyojosho ( the conference chamber ) and handling daily affairs in monthly rotation .
** in that sense , tairo was rather a honorary post for fudai daimyo ( a daimyo who had belonged to the tokugawa group before the battle of sekigahara ) , but some at the post , such as tadakiyo sakai and naosuke ii , concentrated power into their hands .
** the first persons recorded as tairo in the history were toshikatsu doi and tadakatsu sakai ( the lord of obama domain in wakasa province ) who were promoted to the post in 0000 by iemitsu tokugawa .
after that , tadakiyo sakai and naozumi ii assumed the post in the era of ietsuna tokugawa , and the style of tairo as the highest governmental post was established in the era of masatoshi hotta who was appointed the post by tsunayoshi tokugawa , the fifth shogun
** only the members of four families : ii , sakai ( in the linage of uta no kami [director of the bureau of music] ) , doi and hotta were allowed to assume the tairo post .
a fudai daimyo with 000 , 000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) rice yields was sometimes appointed the post , but he was called tairo-kaku ( tairo level ) instead of tairo .
for example , yoshiyasu yanagisawa ' s post was tairo-kaku .
only toshikatsu doi was appointed the tairo post from the doi family .
therefore , the family lost the qualification of a certain amount of rice yields for tairo .
however , the doi family continued occupying an important post in the cabinet officials of the shogunate , for example , toshitsura doi assumed the head of roju ( the post immediately under tairo ) after tempo reforms failed .
** two persons in the tairo post were killed while in office .
masatoshi hotta was killed in the edo castle by wakadoshiyori , masayasu inaba , who was his male cousin .
towards the end of the edo bakufu , naosuke ii was killed in the sakuradamongai incident by roshi ( master-less samurai ) of the mito domain and satsuma domain .
** the ii family
** tairo in a domain was a temporary post set up to assist the lord of the domain , for example , when the lord was young . .
this post name was mainly used in big shinpan domains ( whose lords were relatives of the tokugawa family ) , such as aizu domain .
not all domains had this post .
** machi-bugyo ( town magistrate )
** summary
** a machi-bugyo-sho office
** the monthly rotation system
** others
** machi-bugyo was a name of a governmental post in the edo period that was in charge of administration and judicature in an urban area ( called machi-kata ) in a territory .
this post was also set up not only in the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) but in domains .
however , when just mach-bugyo was used , it generally indicated the edo machi-bugyo that was the governmental post in the bakufu .
the bakufu machi-bugyo in the tenryo cities ( the cities directly controlled by the bakufu ) other than edo were called with the city name added to their heads , for example , osaka machi-bugyo , and was generically called ongoku-bugyo ( literally , bugyo in remote provinces ) .
** on this page , descriptions are made about the edo machi-bugyo and the edo machi-bugyo-sho office ( the office for machi-bugyo ) ( hereafter , bugyo and bugyo-sho office indicates machi-bugyo and machi-bugyo-sho office , respectively , if not specifically mentioned ) .
** edo machi-bugyo , jisha-bugyo ( in charge of temples and shrines ) , and kanjo bugyo ( in charge of finance ) were generically called san ( three ) bugyo .
the members in this post , together with those in the other two bugyo posts were also members of hyojosho ( the conference chamber ) , and were also concerned with affairs in the bakufu government .
the number of officers in this post was basically two .
in the early edo period , daimyo were appointed this post , and later hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu ) .
in the era when hatamoto became to be appointed this post , the amount of rice yields for this post was around 0000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku )
** a machi-bugyo officer went to the edo castle in the morning , reporting to roju members or holding meetings , and in the afternoon , made decisions and held trials , working until late night .
the work in the post was known to be hard , and the rate of death while in office was conspicuous .
** yoriki ( police sergeants ) and doshin ( police constables ) were subordinates of the bugyo officer , but were retainers of the shogun family and worked at a bugyo-sho office hereditarily .
the bugyo officer was merely a hatamoto controlled by roju , therefore there were no direct master-servant relationship between the officer and yoriki and doshin .
if a bugyo officer and a yoriki member were in a master-servant relationship , the yoriki was called uchi-yoriki to differentiate from other ordinary yoriki members .
it is generally depicted , for example , in storytelling , that the kita ( north ) bugyo-sho office and the minami ( south ) bugyo-sho office were in a rival relationship and didn ' t get along with each other .
however , as shown in the later-described relationships between the two bugyo-sho offices , it is said that bugyo officers were outsiders in the area and their relationship of mutual trust was not firm .
** until 0000when the bakufu built machi-bugyo-sho offices , the person appointed a machi-bugyo officer used his residence as the office , executing his job by providing a court ( called shirasu : literally , a white sand area ) in the premise .
** its territory of control was limited to machikata ( the town area ) of edo , and its authority did not cover samurai residences , shrines and temples that occupied more than a half of edo .
however , the control of the town areas in front of the shrines and the temples was transferred to the machi-bugyo .
in 0000 , the edo area was officially specified on a map with a red line ( called shu-biki ) , and at the same time , the area to be controlled by the machi-bugyo was shown with a black line ( called sumi-biki ) .
the area roughly corresponds to that of 00 wards of tokyo , or the area of tokyo city when the city system started .
** the term of machi-bugyo-sho came from the name of the governmental post , therefore , the office was actually called go-bansho ( a police station ) or o-yakusho ( a government office ) by townspeople .
** as the term of kita-machi-bugyo ( -sho ) and minami-machi-bugyo ( -sho ) were often used , two edo-machi-bugyo-sho offices were placed ( except for a certain period ) .
however , this did not mean that the control territory was divided between the two offices .
the job was actually conducted in a monthly rotation system ( however , for each of the doshin officers who walked around watching town situations , jishinban [the town-watching places operated by townspeople themselves] to patrol were specified , and in that sense , a control territory existed naturally .
however , the jishinban places allotted to a doshin officer were scattered all over the edo city area , and were not concentrated in an area , like the xx direction in the present police ) .
in addition , the bugyo-sho office being its off duty turn handled unfinished law suits that were accepted by the office in its on duty turn .
** the term of kita and minami were used for identifying a location where the bugyo-sho office was placed , and were not used officially
officially , each of them was called " machi-bugyo-sho office " uniformly .
therefore , when a bugyo-sho office moved and the relationship between the bugyo-sho office locations changed consequently , the name of the bugyo-sho office that had not moved was also changed .
in 0000 when a residence of a bugyo officer moved to an area within the gate of sukiya-bashi bridge on the southernmost side from an area within the gate of tokiwa-bashi bridge , the new residence became to be called the minami-bugyo-sho office due to its location .
then , the former minami-bugyo-sho office located in an area inside kajiya-bashi bridge became to be called the naka ( middle ) -bugyo-sho office , and the former naka-bugyo-sho office located in an area inside gofuku-bashi bridge became to be called the kita-bugyo-sho office .
** for a short period between august of 0000 and january of 0000 , the naka-machi-bugyo-sho office was introduced as well .
it is not clear why the office was introduced and what its job was , but it is said that the office was established to support the kita- and minami-machi-bugyo-sho offices .
** however , either of them is the site where it existed towards the end of the edo period , or in 0000 and later .
** a list of edo machi-bugyo officers
in the early edo period , neither the kita-machi-bugyo post nor the minami-machi-bugyo posts were introduced yet , with only a bugyo post existing .
although it was not an official machi-bugyo post , its function was essentially the same .
the post of machi-bugyo was officially introduced when the kita-machi-bugyo post and the minami-machi-bugyo post were established . .
the naka-machi-bugyo post was introduced in an intermediate period , but was abolished only after assumed by five persons .
** kanjo bugyo ( commissioner of finance )
** kanjo bugyo was a governmental post in the edo period and the highest accounting officer , who was in charge of finance and control of the tenryo ( the areas controlled directly by the bakufu ) .
this bugyo constituted the three bugyo together with jisha-bugyo ( in charge of affairs of shrines and temples ) and machi-bugyo ( in charge of affairs of town people ) , and these theree bugyo were the members of hyojosho ( a conference chamber ) .
by the genroku era ( 0000 - 0000 ) , this post was also called kanjo-gashira ( the head of accounting officers ) .
in the hyojosho , law suits in kanhasshu ( the eight provinces of kanto region ) except edo-fu were handled by the kanji bugyo .
the number of kanjo bugyo was four , and the amount of rice yields allocated to the officer was 0000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) .
in 0000 and later , one of the kanjo bugyo officers was also in charge of dochu-bugyo ( the post in charge of road-related affairs ) together with ometsuke ( the post of watching daimyo and the imperial court ) .
in 0000 , the post was separated into kattekata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with finance and civil administration and kujikata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with law suit related matters .
the job of the kattekata post and that of the kujikata post were totally different , though they had the same name .
** sanchuro ( three mediators in toyotomi administration )
** sanshuro , which literally means three high-ranking officials called churo , were the posts established in the last days of the toyotomi administration , allowing those three men in the posts to participate in politics , and to mediate between gotairo and gobugyo when they cannot agree .
they were also called kotoshiyori .
** three of chikamasa ikoma , yoshiharu horio , and kazuuji nakamura were appointed .
although ' sanchuro ' appears in some historical sources including ' taikoki ' , it is unclear whether they really functioned or not ; it is considered that they were placed temporarily , or placed as posts to give some authority to the three .
** gobugyo ( magistrates of toyotomi administration )
** it is supposed that the gobugyo system was established in 0000 after hideyoshi toyotomi took office of kanpaku ( " taikoki " by hoan oze ) or in 0000 when hideyoshi established the gotairo system in his illness .
under the toyotomi administration , there were a lot of figures who took charge of administrative affairs , including yoshitsugu otni and yukinaga konishi , and the most prominent five among them were later known as gobugyo ( five bugyo , or five commissioners or five magistrates ) .
** the two of maeda and masuda stayed in the osaka castle .
** bugyo
nagamasa asano , mainly in charge of judicial affairs ( chief of the system , possessed land worth 000 , 000 koku of rice in kofu in kai province )
mitsunari ishida , mainly in charge of administrative affairs ( possessed land worth 000 , 000 koku of rice in sachiyama in omi province )
nagamori masuda , mainly in charge of civil engineering and construction ( possessed land worth 000 , 000 koku of rice in koriyama in yamato province )
masaie nagatsuka , mainly in charge of public finance ( possessed lands worth 00 , 000 koku of rice in minaguchi in omi province )
geni maeda , mainly in charge of religion ( possessed land worth 00 , 000 koku of rice in kameoka in tanba province )
** maeda was responsible for the imperial palace , the imperial court , the court nobles , and the temples and shrines ; nagatsuka was responsible for the special field of the public finance , and asano , masuda , and ishida were responsible for the general political affairs .
** others
there are various other opinions about about the members of the gotairo ; one theory says that yoshitsugu otani was a member of the gobugyo , as geni maeda was treated specially as kyotoshoshidai .
** daishogun ( command in chief )
** daishogun ( also taishogun )
** daishogun in china
in ancient china , the daishogun ( da jiang jun in chinese ) was a bureaucratic rank signifying the highest rank of all generals and was also called jo-shogun ( sha jiang jun in chinese ) .
** although the origin is unknown , the title was used in the warring period of the late qin dynasty by yo chin , who betrayed sheng chen and worked with er zhang to put a soldier on the throne as king zhao .
** the title became a permanent rank in the bureaucracy under han wudi ( han dynasty ) , in his active external policy .
a well-known daishogun during the period is wei qing , who was highly successful in the campaigns against the xiongnu tribes .
** after wudi ' s death , the strength of the maternal side of the imperial family grew and began to intervene in politics , where the leader of such forces was frequently given the title along with political power .
** the title of daishogun remained during the three kingdoms period of chinese history , but with declining power and it evolved into a post of honorary nature .
** daishogun in japan
in japan , the title daishogun was used to designate the top commander to lead a " seitogun " ( expeditionary force ) , when there were more than three generals .
it was also used as a military title when a court noble of sanmi rank ( third rank ) or higher .
** it later became a word referring to military commanders in general and was used as an unofficial title rather than a bureaucratic rank in some instances during the heian period to the early kamakura period .
** however , the titles shogun and daishogun were used more increasingly to refer to the head of the shogunate and were used is declining frequency , except in the case of " seii taishogun . "
a seito daishogun ( the general temporarily appointed for overthrowing the shogunate in the battle of toba-fushimi ) was appointed during the late edo period but it never grew in usage .
** daishogun in onmyodo
** in onmyodo ( way of yin and yang ; occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements ) , the daishogun is the second of the hasshojin ( eight general gods ) and the western god in the yin-yang doctrine .
it is also called mao tenno and hohakushin ( one of the eight gods ) .
** ometsuke ( inspector general )
** this post was also introduced some domains as well .
** although ometsuke was a hatamoto , he watched daimyo , who earned a rice yield of at least 00 , 000 koku .
therefore , his social status in office was equivalent to that for a 00 , 000-koku class daimyo with the title of xx no kami conferred on him as well .
** the number of officers in this post was five .
the ometsuke officer in charge of dochu-bugyo was placed in the head of the five officers .
the officers functioned as a deputy of seii-taishogun ( literally , great general who was to subdue the barbarians ) , as kyoto shoshidai ( the kyoto deputy ) and osaka jodai ( the person sent for controlling the osaka castle ) did .
the ometsuke post was placed above the metsuke post that belonged to the wakadoshiyori post ( a managerial post in edo bakufu ) , and the ometsuke ' s power became increasingly stronger .
** in a domain , the ometsuke officers were mostly selected from the retainers of the domain who were placed under churo ( the post immediately under karo ) , ban-gashira ( a post in the domain government ) and kumi-gashira ( also a post in the domain government ) .
in satsuma domain , the post was called yokome-gashira , and was placed after karo and to wakatoshiyori .
the officers were appointed from samurai in such high classes as issho-mochi ( literally , a one-place holder ) or issho-mochi-kaku ( the issho-mochi level ) .
** koshu ( title )
** origin of the title
** koshu ( 公主 ) indicates the daughters of the chinese emperors .
this was also used a title for them .
** in ancient times , the eldest daughters of emperors were called as genkoshu ( e . g . , the eldest daughter of liu pang was called " lu ( or lo in japanese ) genkoshu , " 魯元公主 , or the genkoshu given the land in lu ) .
in the qing dynasty , the title of koshu were distinguished into two : daughters of empresses were called as 固倫公主 ; and daughters of other imperial consorts as和碩公主 .
** in the northern sung dynasty , the title koshu was abolished for a short time and the title teiki ( 帝姫 ) was used instead ( e . g . , 嘉徳帝姫 . )
it is said that the title teiki was in the style of the shou dynasty .
** in korea , koshu was pronounced as konju , and indicated a daughter of a king and queen , while a daughter from other king consort was given a title of okishu or 翁主 .
accordingly , the title kosh was given to daughters of the emperor and empress in the great korean empire ( 0000-0000 ) .
** in the present people ' s republic of china and the republic of korea , koshu has almost the same meaning as ' o-himesama ' in japanese , meaning a princess , without any legitimate claim to it .
** the origin of this word ' koshu ' is explained by the fact that marriages of daughters of the monarch were presided ( 公 ) by three ministers ( each called as 公 or 侯 ) .
** shogoi
** shogoi ( senior fifth rank ) is one of the ranks in japan ' s aristocratic and religious hierarchies .
it is positioned under jushii ( junior fourth rank ) and above jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) .
when conferred as a posthumous rank , it is called zo-shogoi .
** shogoi
note that the japanese name of the black-crowned night heron " goisagi " comes from an ancient record of the bird given the shogoi rank in the heian period .
** in rare cases , the rank was given as additional honor to middle-rank and lower samurai , not being a chief retainer , who had made major contributions to the meiji restoration .
** agatanonushi ( territorial ruler )
** the term " agatanonushi " refers to a post or kabane ( hereditary title ) of yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) before the introduction of the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
** agata was a kind of province over which yamato sovereignty had direct control .
agata is said to have been a province that ranked below ryoseikoku ( a kind of province )
but there is also a theory that ryoseikoku and agata were treated equally in ancient times .
agata is considered to have been originally a toparchy governed by a local ruling family in ancient times .
however , most of the details are unknown because it was a province in a time when the japanese nation had not yet been systematized under the ritsuryo codes .
agatanonushi gave his great loyalty to yamato sovereignty , unlike kuninomiyatsuko ( local ruling families in ancient japan ) that are said to have been appointed as rulers of the regions formerly governed by them .
agatanonushi is considered to have governed the region as a deputy of yamato sovereignty .
agatanonushi concentrated in western japan , while there were only few agatanonushi in eastern japan .
yamato sovereignty made the local ruling families belonging to it govern their territory in eastern japan where its ruling system was established in a later period than in western japan .
they were appointed as kuninomiyatsuko who were invested with almost full power .
on the other hand , the system to rule the regions formerly governed by the local ruling families was built by yamato sovereignty from early on in western japan where the sovereignty was established during an early period , which was the reason why agatanonushi concentrated in western japan .
** the kabane itself had existed even after the introduction of yakusa no kabane , the eight honorary titles , and the ritsuryo system .
in some cases , agatanonushi has been used as a title also in modern times , and the kamo agatanonushi family of kamo-jinja shrine is a prime example of them .
** kuni no miyatsuko ( regional governor in ancient japan )
** summary
** kuni no miyatsuko was a post , or an official to the post , placed to govern regions across japan before the ritsuryo legal code system was introduced .
it is said that the japanese reading ' miyatsuko ' came from ' miyatsuko ' meaning servants or ' miyatsuko ' meaning retainers of the monarch .
** kuni no miyatsuko means the head of kuni , an administrative district of the yamato kingdom , although the borders of each kuni are not clearly known because the ryoseikoku system , or provinces of japan , was still not well developled .
it is considered that the territories that powerful regional clans had long ruled became recognized as countries ( kuni ) as they were .
the prescribed number of kuni no miyatsuko was not necessarily one ; it is supposed that sometimes two or more kuni no miyatsuko ruled one kuni .
for that reason , the official power of kuni no miyatsuko was so broad that it covered military forces and jurisdiction .
and there were some kuni no miyatsuko who oppsed to the yamato kingdon , including the one in tsukushi , who conquered the entire northern kyushu .
** there is an opinion that the yamato kingdom had a well-organized kokkensei system ( country-province system ) , in which each kuni ruled by kuni no miyatsuko included subdistricts called agata .
the actual conditions of regional rule before introduction of the ritsuryo system is not apparent , because there are a lot of things unknown including the actual conditions of the kuni no miyatsuko system and the relationship between kuni no miyatsuko and the powerful clans in the capital .
** after the taika reform , the positions of kuni no miyatsuko became honorary , succeeded by heredity , as many kuni no miyatsuko dedicated themselves to preside over religious ceremenies , and the conventional duties of kunino no miyatsuko were took over by gunji accordingly
regions ruled by kuni no miyatsuko were gradually reorganized and merged , or divided to replaced by a ' country ' ( kuni or province ) designated in the legal system ( ritsuryo ) of the ancient japan

** daijokan
daijokan 太政官 ( also known as ooimatsurigotonotsukasa ) was the highest organ of state power controlling jurisdiction , administration , and legislation of japan under the ritsuryo legal code system .
the chief of the office was daijodaijin .
usually , sadaijin and udaijin , both of which ranked next to daijodaijin , filled the role of the chief of the office .
the bureaus shonagonkyoku and benkan were placed under the daijokan .
daijokan was also called shoshosho or tosho , its tang name .
** dajokan was a government office established in the new japanese government after the meiji restoration .
it was established based upon the provisional constitution seitaisho ( in the fourth year of the keio era , dajokantasshi no . 000 ) promulgated on june 00 , 0000 .
under dajokan , there were seven offices including giseikan .
after government organizational reform during the next year in 0000 , dajokan presided over the six ministries including the minbusho .
later , the chief of the office dajodaijin was established .
in 0000 , the cabinet was established , and accordingly , dajokan was abolished .
** when the ritsuryo legal code system was introduced from china to ancient japan , two main ministries , jingikan , responsible for worship , and daijokan , responsible for politics , were clearly separated .
daijokan was the highest organ of state power presiding over eight ministries of nakatsukasasho , shikibusho , minbusho , jibusho , hyobusho , gyobusho , okurasho , and kunaisho ( injikanrei ) .
when sessho and kanpaku attended the government in place of the emperor during the heian period , daijokan still functioned as the highest organ of government , although its position was relatively lowered .
daijokan was abolished as the ritsuryo system was abolished during the meiji restoration .
** as other governmental organizations under the ritsuryo legal code system , daijokan was also divided into four ranks of kami , suke , jo , and sakan .
the organization of daijokan was divided into giseikan as the policy-making branch , shonagonkyoku , sabenkankyoku , and ubenkankyoku as bureaus , and junsatsushi as the extraordinary inspector .
under these offices , there were eight ministries .
when gekikyoku was separated from shonagonkyoku later , officials belonged to shonagonkyoku , sabenkankyoku , ubenkankyoku , and gekikyoku , were called jokan .
local administrative officials , chihokan , were placed under the joint control of sabenkankyoku , and ubenkankyoku .

** taikaku
in ancient china , ' taikaku ' ( or also pronounced daikaku ) was an organization that presided over eight ministries , and assisted the emperor in discussing government policies .
when the ritsuryo legal code system was introduced to japan and daijokan was established to preside over the eight ministries , giseikan , the policy-making branch of daijokan , was especially called ' taikaku ' during chinese tang .
taikaku ' was handed over to the dajokan system during the meiji period , and in 0000 , the daijokan system was replaced by the cabinet system led by the cabinet ' naikaku , ' derived from ' taikaku . '
** dajokan , which was differentiated from the above-mentioned daijokan by its pronunciation , was the highest administrative organ established in accordance with seitaisho in 0000 when the meiji restoration took place .
it had the functions of a legislative body , an administrative body , and a judiciary body .
although the name 太政官 under the ritsuryo system was adopted , dajokan during the meiji period underwent several reforms in the organization .
dajokan was abolished in 0000 when the cabinet system started .
** during the period from 0000 to 0000 , government organization did not remain stable as it was frequently reformed or broken up .
an outline of the reformed government organization will be described below .
** in february , the seven branches were established as bureaus and a new bureau sosaikyoku was added so , there were three posts and eight bureaus ( kairikugun branch was renamed gunbokyoku . )
fukusosai , meaning deputy sosai , was established in the sosaikyoku , and held by two of gijo tomomi iwakura and sanetomi sanjo to assist the sosai prince taruhito .
** seitaisho prescribed that the form of the new government should be based on a charter oath of five articles ' the gokajo no goseimon ' and defined separation of power , election of officials , and local administration units fu , han , and ken .
based on seitaisho , a new government system started on june 00 .
** seitai ( the fourth year of the keio era , dajokantasshi no . 000 )
( omitted )
( omitted )
** sosai was abolished among the three posts while prince arisugawa taruhito was staying in edo , and two fukusosai held the position of the virtual head of the government called hosho .
giseikan that was responsible for legislation was made of jokyoku consisting of gijo and sanyo , and kakyoku consisting of representatives called koshi from the domains .
five bureaus of gyoseikan , jingikan , kaikeikan , gunmukan , and gaikokukan were responsible for administration ; especially gyoseikan , headed by hosho , supervised the other four offices .
among the three offices in which three powers of the state were vested , shihokan , that exercised judicial power , was under the supervision of gyoseikan like the above-mentioned four bureaus , which made the independence of the judiciary a mere formality .
as two hosho were members of jokyoku of giseikan , the status of gijo , the separation of power , was merely nominal .
** in 0000 after the boshin war , surrender of domain registers was undertaken , and the domains became local administrative divisions of the government .
then , minbukan , supervising the local administration , was separated from kaikeikan .
subsequently , the election of officials was carried out according to seitaisho so the conservative court nobles and lords were removed .
as an inspector organization , danjodai was established .
** on august 00 , 0000 , a new dajokan system was introduced based upon government structure that underwent the above-mentioned reforms .
the new government system was characterized by placing the offices , to which three powers were vested , under dajokan .
dajokan had ' the three posts , ' consisted of sadaijin , udaijin , three dainagon , and three sangi , to take the command of the office .
those at the three posts took an oath of allegiance and fair administration to emperor meiji by putting their pledge called ' sanshoku meiyaku ' and ' yakusoku shijo ' into effect to the emperor .
** the conservatives succeeded in their scheme of driving out those including takayoshi kido , toshimichi okubo , and taisuke itagaki to the sinecures of jishoingakushi .
iwakura opposed that and additionally appointed okubo and saneomi hirosawa ( takayuki sasaki was added later ) to roll back the situation by consulting sanjo .
** during the period , the issue of merging minbusho and okurasho emerged .
on october 00 , 0000 , the ministries were merged for the purpose of integrating the tax collection and finance systems , and yoshinaga matsudaira , the minbukyo , held the position of okurakyo , and shigenobu ookuma , the okurataifu , held the position of minbutaifu .
that was the scheme of the young officials of kaimeiha faction including ookuma and hirobumi ito , the okurashoyu , whom takayoshi kido , who urged the need of establishing a centralized government , supported .
okubo and others , in alliance with other sangi and local officers , opposed the movement by insisting that the newly merged ministry possessed authority more so than the dajokan , and demanded the expulsion of ookuma and ito and the separation of the ministry .
then in august 0 , 0000 , okubo led the decision to separate the ministry .
** on august 00 , 0000 , haihanchiken was carried out .
** january , 0000 , the eighth year of meiji , toshimichi okubo and hirobumi ito , who were sangi , asked takayoshi kido and taisuke itagaki , who had resigned after a debate about conquering korea , to return to the government as sangi at a meeting in osaka .
in february of the same year , the two parties agreed to gradually transform japan into a constitutional monarchy and decided on the two persons returning to the government .
this system continued until it was replaced by the cabinet system in 0000 .
** laws like the dajokanfukoku and dajokantasshi during this period are considered still effective today , unless the laws established thereafter are inconsistent with them .
it is considered that laws recognized as under the constitution of the great empire of japan are effective today , unless they are inconsistent with the constitution of japan .
** genro ( an elder statesman )
** history
** genro ' as terms appearing in translation
** genro indicates a senior top-level statesman in the japanese government in the era from the latter half of the mejia period to the early showa period .
** in particular , handling the imperial court-related problems became the source of genro ' s authority .
this is apparent from the fact that aritomo yamagata lost his political power because he was defeated in a serious incident in the imperial court .
** the persons to whom shochoku ( an imperial edict ) was issued were hirobumi ito and kiyotaka kuroda .
initially , emperor meiji intended to issue shochoku to hirobumi ito who was going to retire chairman of sumitsu-in ( privy council ) .
however , this was considered unfair for the satsuma domain side in the domain clique of saccho ( the satsuma domain and the choshu domain ) , and kiyotaka kuroda was appointed genro at the same time .
** over time , the number of genro decreased .
after matsukata died , only saionji remained as the genro .
however , in the imperial court , there was a move to regenerate genro .
in addition , matsukata also considered before he died that a new genro should be appointed .
however , saionji , the only remaining genro , was reluctant to appoint such powerful candidates as gombei yamamoto and keigo kiyoura to genro .
in addition , as the council of senior statesmen was established as well , no new genro was appointed and genro disappeared when saionji died in 0000 .
** a list of genro
** all of the genro , except saionji , were from the satsuma domain or the choshu domain .
** by the way , after the first yamagata cabinet resigned en masse , akiyoshi yamada ( from choshu ) recommended the next prime minister together with genkun that was equivalent to genro in the rank .
sasaki positioned eight persons including yamada and seven persons of genro except katsura and saionji , both of whom were appointed to genro later , as ' saccho-genkun ' ( literally , genkun from the satsuma domain or the choshu domain ) .
** the term of ' genro ' is sometimes used for indicating a privileged post for a small number of persons who are engaged in assisting a monarch , in appointment and approval in the core of an administrative organization , such as a cabinet .
however , this rather oldish-sounding term has not been used except for the members of genro-in in rome that often appear in the descriptions of european history .
** shonii

** the early-modern period
** the modern period
** after the effectuation of the constitution of japan
** shonii ( senior second rank ) is one of the ranks in ikai ( court ranks ) and shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) in japan .
this rank is lower than juichii ( junior first rank ) and upper than junii ( junior second rank ) .
** this rank is the equivalent of sadaijin ( minister of the left ) and udaijin ( minister of the right ) in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) in muromachi bakufu and edo bakufu ( japanese feudal governments headed by a shogun ) often stayed in this rank during their tenure as seii taishogun .
in the order of merit , this rank was the equivalent of the supreme order or the first order of merit .
** in the case of people who were conferred shonii upon as a posthumous rank from the heian period to the end of edo period , their ikai ( court rank ) was written as " shonii , posthumously conferred . "
** from the meji period to the end of the second world war , this rank was conferred on such people as an official appointed by the emperor , an imperial appointee as well as the peerage .
** since ikai as an honor stipulated in the constitution of japan is conferred posthumously , it is usually conferred on sanken-no-cho ( chiefs of three organization of powers ) , who rendered distinguished services such as a prime minister , after their death .
** the date is a conferral date .
in the case of a posthumous conferral , an antemortem ikai is additionally indicated for reference .
** the following are all posthumous conferrals .
** hyojoshu ( government post )
** history
** hyojoshu was a government post established during the periods of kamakura and muromachi .
during the kamakura period , hyojoshu was the highest organ of government , which presided over all of administration , jurisdiction , and legislation .
** in 0000 , masako hojo and hioromoto oe , who had supported the kamakura bakufu from the beginning , died , which is considered a reason that the government needed a new council system .
as hyojoshu was headed by the regent , the head was handed down by the hojo clan for generations .
** during the latter half of the kamakura period , hyojoshu turned into a mere formality as the private council presided by the main line of the hojo clan , the then head of the hojo family , gradually came into power .
during the muromachi period , hyojoshu was established as an organization of the muromachi bakufu mainly as just an honorary post with little authority .
** danjonokami ( also known as danjoin ) ( the head of danjodai )
** danjonokami ( also known as danjoin ) was the head of danjodai under the ritsuryo legal code system .
the corresponding court rank was jusanmi ( junior third rank ) .
it took charge of censuring and impeaching violations of the law .
its office danjodai became independent of the two departments and eight ministries to be in charge of prosecution .
it mainly engaged in investigating and arresting all the officials who violated the law except for dajodaijin .
** after the police and judicial chief kebiishi , which was not originally specified in the ritsuryo system , was established in the early ninth century during the heian period , danjonokami became an honorary post given to the imperial family member with little authority .
** seijisosaishoku ( president of political affairs )
** in 0000 , the imperial court in kyoto and the satsuma domain pressured the bakufu so as to appoint yoshinaga matsudaira , the lord of the fukui domain of echigo province , to tairo ( the highest post in the bakufu government ) and yoshinobu hitotsubashi to shogun-kokenshoku .
for this , the bakufu decided to pardon the lords of the hitotsubashi group , including yoshinaga and yoshinobu , on may 00 and appointed yoshinaga to seijisosaishoku , on august 0 .
it is said that this measure was taken because there was no precedent which a lord of shinpan ( the domains whose lords were male descendents of ieyasu tokugawa ) assumed tairo ( the highest position in the bakufu government ) .
yoshinaga , together with yoshinobu , conducted the reformation of shogunate administration in the bunkyu era ( 0000 - 0000 ) .
for this , he was placed in confinement on may 00 , and was dismissed from the seijisosaishoku post .
after that , on november 00 , naokatsu matsudaira , the lord of the kawagoe domain , was appointed as his successor and endeavored to coordinate opinions of the sanyo-kaigi ( councilors ' meetings ) and the bakufu .
however , the post was abolished on july 00 , 0000 .
** taishin
** taishin ( person of high rank and income ) refers to a person who has a high rank and a high stipend .
it refers to a person from a high-ranked wealthy family .

** oe ( title or appellation )
** summary
** brief history of oe
** oe was an appellation and title for powerful imperial princes , used in wa ( ancient japan ) from the first half of the 0th century to the middle of the 0th century .
it is considered that the holder of the title was a successor to the ookimi of the yamato kingdom ( it was also called as amenoshita shiroshimesu ookimi , the emperor in the later ages . )
** there is no contemporary sources that directly describe the meaning of ' oe ' .
therefore , the present historians are inducing the meaning of ' oe ' by comparing the imperial princes who held the title of oe .
although the opinions are different from one another in details , it is generally considered that oe was the title for the imperial prince who were most probably inherit the throne among a lot of the imperial princes .
** the eldest son of the eldest son of ookimi was called oe .
in those days , as the polygynous system was adopted , it seems that there were several oe during the same period , which often led conflicts over the right of succession to the throne .
( on the contrary , there is a theory that insists oe was limited to one person . )
** the first oe appeared in ' nihon shoki ' was the eldest son of emperor keitai , magari no oe ( later , emperor ankan ) , who was active during the first half of the 0th century .
** that means that the order of succession to the throne had not been clearly established in those days , and that the imperial princes held the title of oe did not necessarily succeed to amenoshita shiroshimesu ookimi .
** naka no oe ( later , emperor tenchi ) is supposed to be the last oe .
ootomo no miko ( emperor kobun ) who succeeded emperor tenchi was no longer called oe , and thereafter , the title oe was not used .
that means that the order of succession to the throne had supposedly been clearly established in those days .
probably , the established order was not to pass the throne to his brothers , but to his eldest son immediately after the emperor died .
that might have been a reason that ooama no miko ( later emperor tenmu ) rose in revolt ( the jinshin war ) , because ootomono miko , the eldest son of emperor tenchi , succeeded to the throne and ooama no miko failed to succeeded the throne .
** dazai gonnosochi
** summary
** dazai gonnosochi was the provisional governor general of daziafu in kyushu .
** dazaifu was headed by the governor general , dazai no sochi , and the provisional governor general , dazai gonnosochi .
dazaifu was the general headquarters of the imperial western defense army and controlled over the military power in the kyushu area .
dazai no sochi was regarded as the head of dazaifu , but as there was a convention to appoint the imperial family members to the position after the konin era , the virtual control was held by dazai gonnosochi .
therefore , dazai gonnosochi was the virtual head of dazaifu .
after this period , it became a practice that dazai gonnosochi and dazai daini , an undersecretary to dazai no sochi , were not appointed at the same time .
** as all the interests of trade with the song dynasty of china were held by dazaifu , the former chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) and dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) frequently became dazai gonnosochi for the interests .
** in contrast , dazai gonnosochi was sometimes the position to which the former ministers who had fallen in the central government were demoted .
examples of that kind of dazai gonnosochi includes the imperial prince abo shinno , sugawara no michizane , minamoto no takaakira , fujiwara no korechika , and fujiwara no motofusa .
in the middle of the heian period , ingainosochi became not to be differentiated from gonnosochi so that both of them were titled ' gonnosochi ' .
accordingly , some of those who were appointed the regular dazai gonnosochi worried about their reputation such that taira no korenaka appealed to the government to appoint him dazai no sochi .
** sojaban ( an official in charge of the ceremonies )
** sojaban ( or soshaban ) was a governmental post in the edo bakufu or domains .
the officers in this post managed etiquette of samurai in castles .
** the officer was also in charge of teaching the etiquette concerned with the genpuku ceremony ( the ceremony of celebrating the coming of age ) for the heirs of daimyo who would attend the ceremony in front of shogun .
** the number of sojaban was 00 to 00 customarily , though no specification existed in the bakufu .
according to a commonly accepted theory , nobutomi hongo was the first person appointed to the post in 0000 , but there is another theory insisting that he was not the first .
later , sojaban became a post for fudai daimyo ( a daimyo who had belonged to the tokugawa group from the battle of sekigahara ) as a gateway to success , being mostly the first post for them .
as a liaison officer between a daimyo or a hatamoto and the shogun , this post was an important together with ometsuke ( an inspector ) and metuke ( an inspector under ometsuke ) .
four of the sojaban officers also assumed the jisha-bugyo post ( the post in charge of affairs concerned with shrines and temples ) concurrently ( in 0000 and later ) .
the officers in this post were appointed mostly from tsume-shu ( the persons watching and serving the shogun family ) , whose waiting room in the edo castle was the fuyo ( cotton rose ) room .
** this post was once abolished in september of 0000 due to bunkyu reform , but was restored again in october of the next year .

** after the taiho ritsuryo legal code was enacted , the title ' dazai no sochi ' was established and the imperial prince at third rank or fourth rank or the retainer at junior third rank or sometimes senior third rank were appointed .
in the beginning , dazai no sochi sometimes worked as a stepping stone to dainagon or above as can be seen in the example of ootomo no tabito .
tajihi no miyakemaro in the konin era was the last case to use dazai no sochi as a stepping stone to a higher position .
** dazai gonnosochi or daini was selected from the retainers of the appointee and dispatched as de facto governor ( gonnosochi was dispatched for the appointee at the rank of chunagon , and daini was dispatched for the rank of sangi ) .
** unlike the case of shinoninkoku , dazai no sochi was established merely in customary law and not in the ritsuryo nor kyakushiki ; therefore , sometimes persons not from the imperial family were appointed dazai no sochi .
** the appointment of dazai no sochi continued even after the position became merely nominal until the reform of official system in 0000 .
the last dazai no sochi was prince arisugawa taruhito .

** summary
** definitions of hatamoto in the edo bakufu
** famous hatamoto
** since it originally used to indicate a samurai group who guarded the battle flag of their lord in war areas , it is not a system only in tokugawa period .
** hatamoto was organized mostly by hereditary vassals , and constituted the samurai group for guarding the main war base of the lord in fighting .
at that time , the local samurai lords who were subordinated to a lord but controlled their territories independently aligned and realigned with each other freely .
under such a background , it is considered that lords relied on the hatamoto strongly and that the hatamoto were involved in the governments centrally .
** typical examples of hatamoto in the edo period were retainers of the tokugawa clan who originated in mikawa .
** those who were from the families of former noble clans and responsible for protocol , such as the kira clan , the hatakeyama clan , the imagawa clan , and the takeda clan were called koke ( master of ceremonies ) and separated from other retainers .
initially , the number of koke families including the kira family was three , but gradually increased up to 00 .
being mostly provided with the rice crop of around 0 , 000 koku , the earnings of these koke were often smaller compared with their family statuses or their governmental post levels .
governmental posts that should be given to a 000 , 000-koku class daimyo were sometimes given to koke-kimoiri ( dominant families of the koke families ) , but their earnings were always less than 0 , 000 koku .
** the retainers who belonged to the social standing of omemie ( vassal with the privilege to have an audience with the shogun or under that were called " gokenin " ( immediate vassal of the shogunate ) .
** life of hatamoto
** hatamoto and gokenin were governed by buke shohatto ( laws for the military houses ) , and were placed under control of wakadoshiyori ( junior councilor ) .
they had to reside basically in edo , but the kotai-yoriai families were provided with a jinya ( a regional government office ) in their chigyosho ( hatamoto ' s fief ) .
for the hatamoto with 000 koku or less , who constituted most of hatamoto , the right to manage their fief except collecting tax , were entrusted to governmental officers of the bakuku , called daikan or gundai .
the bakufu disliked the execution of right to manage their fief by the hatamoto retainers who possessed their own territories , and took the policy of curbing the execution .
however , because they needed securing tax and were also responsible for scandals in their territories , some hatamoto executed their right to manage their fief actively , even though they earned a 000 koku or less of rice crop .
** it was commonly said that ' the number of hatamoto was 00 , 000 . '
however , in a survey in 0000 , the number was approximately 0 , 000 , and was 00 , 000 including even the gokenin of omemie or under .
however , it is said that the number became roughly 00 , 000 , when the retainers of hatamoto and of gokenin were further included ( for this , the number of military personnel allowed for a 000 , 000-koku daimyo was 0 , 000 ) .
** the hatamoto who earned a 0 , 000 koku or more of rice crop including kotai-yoriai was approximately 000 .
those who earned a 0 , 000 koku or more of rice crop was approximately 000 , and 00 percent of hatamoto earned a 000 koku or less of rice crop . .
** in as early as in the kanei era ( 0000 - 0000 ) in 00 years after the bakufu was established , ' impoverishment of hatamoro ' became a problem .
kienrei ( a relief measure to help the gokenin and hatamoto who fell into economic difficulties during the edo period ) in the kansei reforms was enacted under such a situation as well .
** governmental posts for hatamoto
** the highest post available for hatamoto was the keepers of edo-jo castle .
after yoshimune , the eighth shogun , established the gosankyo ( three lords : three junior collateral houses of the tokugawa family ) , the position of karo ( chief retainers ) at these families were considered to be equivalent in the status to the keepers of edo-jo castle .
however , it was not rare that a hatamoto at the 0 , 000-koku level was selected for such a post .
the gosankyo had their residences in the edo-jo castle , and they were treated as the members of shogun family .
therefore , the karo of gosankyo were not baishin ( indirect vassal ) .
** the ongoku-bugyo ( magistrates placed at important areas directly controlled by the government ) placed by the bakufu at important cities was selected among the thousand-koku class hatamoto .
however , the fushimi magistrate was an exceptional post to which a fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the tokugawa family ) was appointed as well .
fushimi was a key point to enter kyoto from the tokai-do road , and in sankin-kotai ( daimyo ' s alternate-year residence in edo ) , it was prohibited to proceed to the kyoto side from fushimi , to prevent daimyo from making contact with the imperial court .
the nikko magistrate where shogun was used to visit was provided with a status slightly higher than that of other ongoku-bugyo .
the nagasaki magistrate post was the most coveted one , because additional income , being close to bribes , was expected in relation with trade , and therefore , various maneuvers were conducted to get the post .
some hatamoto who became nagsaki magistrate established a big fortune .
** some gokenin assumed lower posts for hatamoto .
** hiroshiki , makanai-gashira , and kanjo-ginmi-aratame yaku were selected among the competent hatamoto with small stipend .
** after the mid-edo period , no gokenin has promoted to hatamoto in the military and guard spheres .
on the other hand , some gokenin who assumed lower-level governmental posts under hiroshiki or kanjo-bugyo promoted to hatamoto .
** in order for a person not entitled to be a hatamoto to become hatamoto , it was basically required his family to have assumed posts for hatamoto for three consecutive generations .
however , once permitted to have an audience with the shogun , he was immediately recognized as hatamoto as omemie-no-shi ( vassal with the privilege to have an audience with the shogun ) .
** by the way , the bankata were classified into the five posts of koshogumi ( page corps ) , shoinban ( the castle guards ) , oban ( castle guards ) , shinban ( new guard ) and kojunin ( escort guard ) .
these posts were called goban ( kata ) ( five ban posts ) .
** yoriki ( police sergeant ) attached to the town magistrate ' s offices were allowed to ride on a horse and often provided with a salary of a 000 koku ( 000 straw bags ) of rice crop , but they were not hatamoto .
** in the following bunkyu reforms ( reforms in the bunkyu era [0000 - 0000] ) , the military system was reformed rapidly : for example , military officers were selected among the hatamoto who had completed the training of rifle shooting and gunnery , based on their competence .
however , for the hatamoto who were at the peak of financial poverty , there was no power remained to support the military service .
therefore , in september 0000 , the military service imposed on hatamoto was actually abolished , and it was decided that a half of the revenue from their fief to be collected ( in four installments ) as money for military use .
due to the taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) occurred during the first collection , the bakufu had collapsed before this system functioned fully .
** because the kiregawa family with a less than 00 , 000 koku of rice crop was treated as a daimyo , the family was not included in the hatamoto in the broad sense as well .
** in this case , they were entitled to have an audience with the shogun , and was allowed to dismount a horse at check points during their sankin kotai .
therefore , in the broadest sense , the hatamoto indicated those who were entitled to have an audience with the shogun , excluding daimyo and those who were treated as daimyo .

** jo ( third official among shitokan )
** summary
** title jo in joruri
** jo was the third official among shitokan under the japanese ritsuryo system .
the letter ' 掾 ' ( jo ) indicates the third official of the provincial governor kokushi , corresponding to ' 判官 ' ( jo ) in the central government .
** especially in the highest rank of ryoseikoku provinces called taigoku , daijo , meaning higher jo , and shojo , meaning lower jo , were established .
the letter ' 掾 ' is read ' en ' in japanese by onyomi , the japanese reading derived from the original chinese pronunciation .
** the title jo remained last for the joruri performers .
after wwii , kotsubodayu toyotake ii was given yamashiro no shojo from chichibunomiya-ke in 0000 , and bungoro yoshida iv was given naniwa no jo from higashikuninomiya-ke in 0000 .
** shonagon ( post in daijokan )
** shonagon was a post in daijokan , which was the highest organization in the imperial court .
its chinese name in the tang dynasty , i . e . , chinese style name , was kyujichu .
shonagon corresponds to jo among the four officials .
its corresponding court rank was jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) .
the prescribed number of the position was three , but ingai no shonagon and gon no shonagon were extraordinary established in some periods .
** their major duties were clerical works related with official documents of imperial edicts , maintenance and keeping of the seal of emperor , the seal of daijokan , and bells ekirei .
further , when kurododokoro , an extra statutory office , was established , the status and duties of shonagon as personal attendants to the emperor were significantly absorbed by kurododokoro so that confucians were mostly appointed shonagon to merely maintain and keep the seals and bells .
as the practical business of shonagon was performed by daigeki and shogeki ( prescribed number was two for each ) , shonagonkyoku began to be called gekikyoku .
** in and after the late medieval period , shonagon was known as the official position appointed to the court nobles from the funabashi family in the kiyohara clan line , after having served as a tutor to the emperor .
** benkan ( collective name of posts in daijokan )
** official duties
** benkankyoku
** its chinese name in the tang dynasty , i . e . , chinese style name , was shosho .
** daiben corresponded to junior fourth rank , upper grade , and chuben corresponded to senior fifth rank , lower grade ( taihorei kanirei . )
** later , as the prescribed number of the provisional posts established for benkan was decided one , it was called ' seven ben . '
during the middle of the heian period , gon no sachuben was established in many cases , but during the reign of the cloistered emperor , gon no uchuben was usually established .
** the duties of benkan was to direct and supervise the government offices ; therefore , they were ranked higher than shonagon later , and some officials concurrently held the posts of sangi and daiben .
some officials who concurrently held the posts of kurodonoto and daiben or chuben were especially called tonoben .
** sachuben was considered the first step on the ladder of the promotion to third rank or above , as the officials who served as sachuben or above were qualified to be promoted to sangi , but those who served as uchuben and below were not qualified .
** benkankyoku was an important office that was in charge of practical business of daijokan under the giseikan ( daijin , dainagon , chunagon , sangi ) , and was collectively called daijokan sankyoku together with shonagon .
** daishi corresponded to senior sixth rank and shoshi corresponded to senior seventh rank ( taihorei kanirei ) , and until the kamakura period , it became a practice that sadaishijoshu was promoted to fifth rank and called taifushi .
** daishi and shoshi administered recording of received official documents , drawing up and signing of drafts , examining delay or negligence in public services , and reading up of official documents ( taihorei shokuinrei . )
the others such as shisho , kajo , and jikicho were zoninkan without corresponding court ranks , and engaged in miscellaneous businesses including copying documents , announcing of an accuser , and the like .
the prescribed numbers were two for each of left ( sa ) and right ( u ) daishi and shoshi , ten for shisho , and two for kajo .
** after otsuki no tomochika was appointed sadaishi at the end of the 00th century , descendants of his stem family succeeded sadaishi for generations .
around the 00th century , the otsuki clan conventionally monopolized the post of sadaishi .
sadaishi , which presided over benmukyoku , was called kanmu , and the otsuki clan handing down the title of kanmu for generations began to be called kanmu family .
** genkun
** genkun ( the statesmen who contributed to meiji restoration ) refer to the politicians who made considerable achievements in the overthrow of the shogunate and the meiji restoration , played an important role in the meiji government , and were from kinno-no-shishi ( a royalist ) .
** among the 0 people , the latter four people lived long until the period under the meiji constitution : hirobumi ito , kaoru inoue , aritomo yamagata and kinmochi saionji .
** sobayonin ( lord chamberlain )
** sobayonin in domains
** sobayonin in the edo bakufu
** sobayonin was a post in the bakufu and domains in the edo period .
the official post name was osoba-goyonin .
** the sobayonin placed in domains was sometimes called osoba for short .
for lords , there were the public sphere and the private sphere , and karo managed whole domain administration , while the sobayonin managed the family affairs of the lord family and played a role of a secretary of the lord and his heir .
however , the name and jobs of the sobayonin were not universal , and importance of the post depended on the domain .
** in the bakufu , the sobayonin sometimes gained more power than roju ( the second highest post in the bakufu government or a person ( s ) in the post ) , but in domains , such an example scarcely existed .
however , because of the characteristics of the post , a person from a low social standing family was often appointed to the sobayonin post when he was a competent close confidant trusted deeply by the lord , so the load of the post was invariably heavy .
in some domains , a sobayonin officer was also provided with the title of osoba-goyo-toritsugi , and in this case , the function of the officer was almost the same as those of a sobayonin officer in the bakufu .
** the sobayonin officer in domains are generally selected from at least kyujin ( lower-ranked one of the upper class retainers ) or upper class retainers ranked at moshitsugi ( or toritsugi ) ( an official for conveying a message ) .
furthermore , in many domains throughout the nation , heirs of senior retainers served as kosho ( pages ) or sobayonin officers when they were in the heyazumi status ( living in their parents ' houses ) before inherited their family head positions
the sobayonin post was mostly placed under the yonin post , but in some domains , for example , the mito domain and the kaga domain , it was placed above the yonin post .
compared to the yonin post and the banto post , the status level depended on the domain .
** sobayonin officers in the edo bakufu were close confidants of seii taishogun ( literally , " the great general who was to subdue the barbarians " ) , and played a role of informing roju or other officers of instructions from shogun .
a rice yield of 00 , 000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) was given to the post .
** in 0000 , masatoshi hotta , tairo ( the highest post in the bakufu government to the person in the post ) was slain with a sword in the edo castle by masayasu inaba , his cousin and a wakadoshiyori officer .
this incident led the goyobeya room ( office room ) of roju to be moved to a place far away from the residence of the shogun , in the pretext of worrying about his safety .
therefore , power of the sobayonin officer , who mediated between the shogun and the roju and played the role of relaying instructions from shogun to roju , increased suddenly .
the politics style which the government was operated by sobayonin rather than by roju was called ' sobayonin seiji ' ( sobayonin-based politics ) by historians in later eras .
shogun exercised dictatorship through the sobayonin officer , and the officer came to be used by shogun as a means of containing power of roju .
** after narisada makino retired , tsunayoshi appointed yoshiyasu yanagisawa , who had been makino ' s close aide since makino was karo of the tatebayashi domain , and showed more favor to yoshiyasu than to makino .
in addition , around this time , tsunayoshi started losing enthusiasm for politics , and the intention of yanagisawa was sometimes conveyed as that of the shogun .
furthermore , it became custom that the sobayonin officer could refuse a matter which roju requested to relay to the shobun but the sobayonin officer was against it .
although having never been appointed to roju , yanagisawa was given kamiza ( seat of honor ) of roju and the title of roju-kau ( roju level ) , occupying the highest post of the bakufu government both in name and reality .
although no such a title was provided for akifusa manabe in the next generation , he possessed more power than roju accutually .
in the tsunayoshi era and later , the bakufu operation was conducted mainly through sobayonin ( or goyotoritsugi ) , completing the political style called dictatorship by shogun .
** however , yoshimune did not make them daimyo immediately after appointing them to the new post , and did not permit them to deliver political remarks that were allowed for roju nor to refuse relaying messages from roju to shogun .
** when the ninth shogun , ieshige , who is said to have suffered from speech disorder , became the ninth shogun , only his confidants who had been his attendantspersons could understand his ambiguous speech .
therefore , tadamitsu ooka , one of his confidants , became in charge of important matters , restoring the sobayonin system .
however , ieshege and ieharu , the shogun who succeeded the ieshige , did not want to be involved in political matters actively , therefore , it can also be said that the sobayonin officers , such as ooka and okitsugu tanuma , came to have strong power naturally .
of them , tanuma was the first person who officially assumed roju from sobayonin through roju-kaku .
** kizoku ( nobles )
** the concept of kizoku and its coverage
** kizoku in japan
** ancient times
** the medieval period
** early modern times
** modern times
** kizoku in ancient rome
** kizoku in china
** kizoku in korea
** kizoku in ryukyu
** kizoku in europe and in russia
** kizoku in the islamic world
** kizoku in india
** kizoku in southeast asian nations
** kizoku indicated persons whose social privileges were generally recognized due to their blood lines or their family statuses and also indicated the clans of such persons .
this term was also used for indicating their social status .
the kizoku status was mostly inherited , but there were also persons who were promoted to kizoku newly due to their distinguished contributions .
in some terminologies , the clan of the monarch , which was called " kozoku " ( 皇族 ) , " ozoku " ( 王族 ) , or " kozoku " ( 公族 ) , was excluded from the coverage of the term of kizoku .
** the range of meaning covered by the term kizoku ( nobles ) depended upon the nation , and therefore , use of the term must be done carefully .
** in japan , the term of shizoku ( 士族 ) was used for indicating , during the meiji period and later , the former samurai class that was placed under the kazoku class .
therefore , shizoku originally indicated kizoku itself .
** therefore , kizoku is used globally for indicating a broad class that was placed above the common people class and was provided with various privileges hereditarily , and sometimes includes the kozou class , the ozoku class and the priest class as well , depending upon the terminology .
therefore , when using this term , it is necessary to be careful about these differences in concepts involved in the term .
** in the early medieval period , the kuge ( court noble ) class was established based upon them .
the kuge class existed until the meiji restoration era , though continued losing real power in economic affairs as well as in political affairs .
** it is considered that kizoku in japan was first introduced in the period from the latter half of the seventh century to the early eighth century when the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) was established .
the base of the kizoku was the gozoku class .
in yamato ( japan ) in the seventh century and before , blood-related family groups , each called an uji ( clan ) , had been formed , and the uji group heads formed the gozoku class .
the yamato sovereignty ( ancient japan sovereignty ) at that time had the characteristics of the coalition government of these uji groups , or gozoku , as well .
however , in the tenchi and tenmu periods and later in the latter half of the seventh century , power was rapidly concentrated at the emperor level ( okimi - great king ) and gozoku in the capital were reorganized into government officers .
** in taiho ritsuryo ( codes during the taiho era from 000 to 000 ) established in 000 , former gozoku were ordered according to their ikai ( court ranks ) .
the sanmi ( third ) and higher ranks were called " ki , " and the yoni ( fourth ) rank and the goi ( fifth ) rank " tsuki . "
" ki " indicated noble persons , and " tsuki " the class akin to noble persons .
these " ki " persons , " tsuki " persons , and their clans were called kizoku .
the privileges given to the " tsuki " persons were significantly different from those given to the " ki " persons .
therefore , the " ki " persons ranked as the upper kizoku , and the " tsuki " persons the middle or lower kizoku .
lots of national revenue was given to kizoku as an economical privilege .
in addition , servants were also provided based upon the rank or official post .
a distinct difference was provided between the revenue of persons at the sami or higher rank and those at yoni or goi rank , and still more difference between the revenue of the persons at goi or higher rank and those at rokui ( sixth ) or lower rank .
in addition , there was also a privilege called the oni system in which a person ' s descendents could be awarded certain ranks based on his rank .
due to the oni system , persons in the kizoku class could make it easier for their descendents to inherit their various privileges .
** a feature of the ritsuryo system in japan was that , when a political decision was made , importance was placed at daijokan ( the grand council of the state ) , a kizoku consultation council .
under the ritsuryo codes in tang , the ministry called chushosho , placed directly under the emperor , and the ministry called monkasho , consisting of members from kizoku , confronted political decisions .
however , in the ritsuryo codes in japan , the chumusho ministry , placed directly under the emperor , was placed under daijokan .
this fact indicated that japan evaluated the roles of kizoku more highly than china did .
** it was customary that only one person from each clan could become a giseikan officer , and therefore , the giseikan was provided with the characteristics of a meeting of representatives from the clans .
however , as more than one person from the fujiwara clan became giseikan officers from about 000s , the number of giseikan officers from other clans gradually diminished , corresponding to the increase in the number of giseikan officers from the fujiwara clan .
** even in the kizoku society as a whole , the number of kizoku persons from the fujiwara clan increased , while those from the other clans declined
it is said that it was towards the end of the eighth century to the early ninth century that such a trend accelerated .
akiko yoshie proposes the theory that the locality and ryozokusei ( 両属性 ) having been possessed by clans was lost in this era , making the clans reorganize .
** about the 000s , the clan diversity of giseikan officers was lost , with most of the officers being persons from the fujiwara clan or from the minamoto clan .
the fujiwara clan secured the sessho ( regent ) and kanpaku ( top adviser to the emperor ) posts , and was successful in making these posts inherited .
however , contrary to the common understanding , the sekkan families did not use their power exclusively for their own favors .
even persons at sekkan families could not decide national political affairs autocratically , and all nationally important political affairs were decided through a conference , for example , jin no sadame ( ancient cabinet council ) , whose members were kugyo .
** in the early tenth century when the nation-governing system changed to an ocho kokka ( royal-court state ) system , the kanshiukeoisei system , in which ritsuryo-based functions and rights were entrusted to specific persons , began .
then , middle or lower kizoku members successfully entrusted with such a function or had the right position to acquire the function or the right to execute it as their family business , came to inherit it as a hereditary family business for generations .
kanshiukeoi ( actions based upon the kanshiukeoisei system ) and the inheritance of such family businesses came to appear widely in the kizoku society during the eleventh century and later .
middle or lower kizoku attempted to survive by inheriting such a family business or by acquiring a zuryo ( the head of the provincial governors ) post .
as family assets were accumulated through the inheritance of such a family business , the concept of " family " appeared in kizoku society .
** the first half of the tenth century , when sessho and kanpaku-based politics , the kanshiukeoi system , and the inheritance of such a family businesses started , was also the era when standard styles of rituals in the imperial court and religious rituals were established .
for rituals consisting of numerous annual events , detailed etiquette and patterns were determined , and such books concerned with rituals like " saikyuki " and " hokuzansho " were written in order to smoothly execute these rituals .
** the " family " concept that appeared in kizoku society reached the emperor in the latter half of the eleventh century , starting the insei political style in which the head of the imperial family administered the affairs of the state as the retired emperor .
the " family " concept spread widely among upper kizoku members as well , and the shoen ( manor ) territories were accumulated as family properties and were inherited from the father-side lineage .
until then , it was customary in kizoku society to inherit assets from the mother-side lineage , but inheritance from the father-side linage became customary around the twelfth century .
** until around the eleventh century , a major economical base of kizoku was placed on the iden and/or ifu supplied by the state , as in the nara period , and not much income was available from shoen .
** the start of the insei political system introduced families to kizoku society , and then strife for gaining leadership among family members gradually became intensified .
the hogen war during the middle era of the twelfth century was the most extreme case of such strife .
the political power struggle in kizoku society was solved with arms , and this fact enabled the taira no kiyomori , clan , who achieved prominent accomplishments during the war , to rapidly gain power .
having been only a middle military kizoku class member , taira no kiyomori could join upper kizoku through the succeeding heiji war .
however , the taira no kiyomori clan became extinct after the jisho-juei civil war , and the government of minamoto no yoritomo , who originated in military kizoku , won the war .
however , minamoto no yoritomo did not become a member of the upper kizoku and was selected to become the ruler ( kamakura-dono ) of the togoku ( the eastern part of japan , the kanto region in particular ) government ( kamakura bakufu )
** as the kamakura bakufu , which served the imperial court militarily , came to be called buke ( military families ) , former kizoku were called bunkan , who served the imperial court in administrative affairs , or in other words , kuge .
while the bakufu , controlling the togoku region , was called the buke government , the imperial court , located in the center of the nation , was called the kuge government as well .
from the twelfth to the thirteenth century , the social status of families in kuge society became increasingly more fixed , with governmental posts that were reachable depended upon the social status of the family .
** the controllable areas of the kamakura bakufu was initially limited to the togoku region , not reaching the saigoku ( the western part of japan ) region that was under control of the imperial court .
however , becoming dominant by winning the jokyu war in 0000 , the bakufu came to participate in the watch of the imperial court as well as in deciding the person who would inherit the title of emperor , extending its control rights by advancing into the saigoku region .
the imperial court ( kuge government ) continued to exist thereafter as well , and sometimes made an effort , together with the bakufu ( buke government ) , to solve political problems , but gradually lost its political and governing powers .
** major income sources of kizoku during the kamakura period were shoen territories and chigyo-koku as in around the end of the heian period .
however , during this period , jito ( shoen managers ) who were samurai came to erode the shoen territories of kizoku with their military power as a background .
because , entering the muromachi period , strong power was given to shugo ( the military commander and administrator in a province ) , shugo , replacing jito , eroded shoen more conspicuously .
in this way , the control of shoen ( manors ) and koryo ( public lands ) by kizoku was gradually lost , and the shoen koryo sei had almost collapsed by the latter half of the fifteenth century , the middle era of the muromachi era ,
it was customary until the early muromachi period for kizoku to reside in the capital ( kyoto ) and wait for an income that was to be brought to kyoto from the shoen and koryo concerned .
however , after that , they sent his daikan ( representative ) directly to his shoen manor ( called ukeoi-daikansei : literally , a daikan-entrusting system ) , and there were even cases where a kizoku member himself went to his shoen manor to control it .
** furthermore , following the start of the muromachi bakufu whose base was located in kyoto , the functions of the kuge government were transferred to the bakufu as well , and the kuge government almost lost its function as a government in the era of the yoshimitsu ashikaga administration .
having lost the economic base as well as political power , persons in the kizoku class suffered from dire poverty in the era from the middle of the muromachi period to the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) ( in japan ) .
** in early modern times , after the edo bakufu was established , the attempt was made to restructure the social status system that had become scarcely functional during the sengoku period .
for persons in the kizoku class , the bakufu established kinchu narabini kuge shohatto ( a set of regulations that were applied to the emperor and kuge nobles ) , forcing the kuge society to be controlled by the bakufu .
in kuge society , family status had become fixed in the kamakura period and later .
** several hundred to 0 , 000 koku ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) of rice crops was allocated as a salary to each upper kizoku class member , such as kugyo , but only several tens koku of rice crop to each middle or lower kizoku class member .
therefore , there were many kizoku families who lived in poverty .
** in 0000 , the meiji government created the kazoku system for the new kizoku class .
the kazoku members consisted of former imperial family members , kuge , daimyo , and those who distinguishingly served during the meiji restoration .
privileges in social statutes as well as in property were given to kazoku members , and when the constitution of the empire of japan was established in 0000 , they were given the privilege of becoming members of the house of peers ( in japan ) .
** however , when the constitution of japan , stipulating the prohibition of the kizoku system and equality under the law , was enforced , the kazoku system was abolished , ending the kizoku status in japan .
however , the emperor system , a form of a kizoku system , had been conserved as an exception .
** however , over time , the power of common people was strengthened , the tribune post was established , and common people could become administrative rulers .
towards the end of republican rome , the power of kizoku and that of common people became almost equal , with only a few privileges remaining still .
as for political group names , the common people group and the kizoku group existed , but these terms did not indicate their actual status .
** entering the roman empire period , the title of kizoku was newly given to those who distinguishingly contributed to the empire , in addition to traditional kizoku .
the titles of local government posts in the roman empire ( duces and comes ) became the origins of duke and count .
** for more information , refer to " patoriki " ( patricii ) .
** refer to kizoku ( in china ) .
** refer to yangban ( traditional ruling class or nobles of dynastic korea during the joseon dynasty )
** refer to ikai ( court ranks ) in ryukyu .
** feudal kizoku in europe was based on the germanic system , and the system in the frankish kingdom in particular .
** refer to peerage as well , to check the corresponding comparisons between the five peerage titles in japan and the peerage titles in europe .
each german kizoku member attached " von " or " zu " before its name , and each french kizoku member " de . "
** local officials in the frankish kingdom later became counts .
** the local officials in national-boundary areas were called markgraf , later becoming marquis .
** powerful local ruling families , other than those described above , were later called baron .
** with the germanic tribe system still remaining in germany , the tribe heads who possessed a vast territory become duke ( a title ) .
in other regions , persons who are , for example , a member of a royal family and are given a vast territory , became duke .
** the title placed under count , initially called vice-count became viscount .
** a knight was initially a honorary title for warriors who fought on a horse , but later became one who held the no kizoku title .
** in england as well , most of present kizoku were appointed newly to kizoku in this era .
** through people ' s revolutions in modern times , titles of kizoku were abolished in many nations , or remained nominally with no privileges allowed .
some nations ( italy and portugal ) maintain a kizoku system , even though having abolished the monarchy .
in these nations , kizoku possess a few privileges as well .
refer to genealogisches handbuch des adels or the category ( categoryadelsgeschlecht )
in addition , some name lists include a kizoku member list .
** azuma hyakkan
** azuma hyakkan referred to a person ' s name that looked like a government post and was used by the samurai in the kanto region .
however , azuma hyakka was not a formal government position of the imperial court , but was just a name created by imitating a government post of the imperial court .
like hyakkan na ( a name taken after his/her or family ' s official rank ) , azuma hyakkan was put after miyoji ( a family name ) and before imina ( a personal name ) .
** summary
azuma hyakkan is also called souma hyakkan , and there is a legend that these names were introduced as a government post system by taira no masakado when he named himself a new emperor and formed a new government .
** in contrast to hyakkan na based on the organization of government according to the ritsuryo codes of the imperial court , this government-post-like name used in kanto was called azuma hyakkan or buke hyakkan .
originally , a samurai ' s appointment to an officer was applied to the imperial court through the bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ; baishin ( indirect vassal ) and roju ( vassal ) were not given any government position .
these government-post-like nanori which were created without any historical background and used in the samurai society were called azuma hyakkan , and were distinguished from the actual names of government positions .
azuma hyakkan was also used in the edo period , and scholars in the edo period criticized it by saying , ' you should not announce yourself as such without an ancient and honorable origin . '
however , even influential samurai families as well as children of good families took the name of azuma hyakkan .
** six great educators in the meiji period
** the term " the six great educators in the meiji period " refers to a special , collective title of six great educators who contributed a great deal to promoting the modern education in the meiji period .
** in 0000 , a large national meeting of educators was jointly held by the imperial educational society , the educational society of tokyo prefecture and the educational society of tokyo city at the auditorium of tokyo kuramae higher technical school .
six great educators were posthumously awarded in the meeting .
four educators were selected on account of founding respected private schools that had been already given special treatment as ' the four great imperial private schools . '
after that , two educators who reformed the educational system were added to the above-mentioned four educators so that the great educators totaled six .
a ceremony to award an honor to the six great educators posthumously was held .
for this reason , they are often introduced as ' one of the great six educators in the meiji period . '
** the six great educators include the following persons :
** takato oki : established a modern educational system as monbukyo ( chief of ministry of education ) .
makoto kondo : founded an incorporated educational institution , kogyokusha gakuen , and played an active part mainly in mathematics , engineering and navigation .
masanao nakamura : founded dojinsha ( a private school ) and published many translations such as saigoku risshihen ( a translation from self-help written by samuel smiles )
joseph hardy neesima ( joe niijima ) : founded an incorporated educational institution , the doshisha , to educate many talented persons in the fields of english and christianity .
yukichi fukuzawa : founded an incorporated educational institution , gakko hojin keio gijuku , and was a famous thinker in many fields , especially in law and economics .
arinori mori : was the representative of the founders of meirokusha ( japan ' s first academic society ) , and reformed the educational system as the minister of education .
** kogyokujuku ( the original name of kogyokusha gakuen ) , keio gijuku and dojinsha in tokyo are collectively referred to as ' the three great private schools in the meiji period ' or ' the three great private schools ' in some cases .
these collective names are also based on the evaluation of private schools during the period of the meiji restoration , which was summarized by the imperial educational society from the taisho period to the early showa period .
but the imperial educational society referred to them as ' the three great private schools in the imperial capital ' at that time .
these schools came to be referred to as ' the three great imperial private schools in the meiji period , ' etc . in the taisho period .
however , there is no literature showing that the imperial educational society referred to them as the three great private schools .
** kaiganbogyo-goyogakari ( a governmental post of the edo bakufu )
** kaiganbogyo-goyogakari was a governmental post of the edo bakufu .
this post was commonly called " kaibogakari " as well .
** corresponding to this situation , the post of kaiganbogyo-goyogakari was established , centered on masahiro abe , the head of roju ( the second-highest post in the bakufu government ) , to investigate how the bakufu should defense the nation on the sea .
** when perry ' s fleet arrived , ieyoshi tokugawa , the shogun at that time , was dying , so it was impossible to expected of him to execute his political power at the national emergency .
furthermore , he restored kaibogakari , and appointed the following persons to kaiganbogyo-goyogakari .

** the members of kaibogakari , including nariaki tokugawa , submitted coastal defense measures actively to the bakufu .
however , in the next year , masayoshi hotta , who had become the head of roju replacing abe , concluded the japan-u . s . treaty of peace and amity with the united states .
angered by the situation , nariaki tokugawa resigned from the coastal defense officer , ending the mission of kaibogakari of the bakufu .
** kanjoginmiyaku ( a governmental post in the edo period )
** chronological table
** kanjoginmiyaku was a governmental post in charge of auditing all jobs in the kanjo-sho office ( the office for finance ) in the edo bakufu .
** kanjoginmiyaku was installed at the kanjo-sho office , and the officers were appointed from hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu ) or gokenin ( also direct retainers of the bakufu , but lower-ranked than hatamoto ) .
though being ranked next to the kanjo-bugyo post in the kanjo-sho office , this post was not under the kanjo-bugyo post but under roju ' s direct supervision ( the second-highest post in the bakufu government ) .
osadame-inzu ( the number of officers ) was four to six .
each of the officers was given a 000 koku of rice crop ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) for its rank status and 000 straw bags of rice crop for its job .
ordinarily , the officers waited in the nakano-ma room .
** kanjoginmiyaku officers audited all of these jobs .
any financial expenditure had to be supported by the kanjoginmiyaku officers .
since it was directly under the control of roju , the officers had the authority of informing rouj immediately of the wrong acts done by officers in the kanjo-sho office , including kanjo-bugyo officers .
** this post , initially established by tsunayoshi tokugawa , was once abolished by shigehide ogiwara at his own discretion in the genroku era ( 0000 - 00-0 ) ) , but was restored by hakuseki arai .
in the kyoho era ( 0000 - 0000 ) , the post was separated into ginmi-yaku ( audit post ) for financial affairs and ginmi-yaku for law suits .
later , in the horeki era ( 0000 - 0000 ) , 00 subordinates were placed under each of these officers according to an order from ieshige tokugawa , establishing the system as an independent inspection and audit organization .
** when a baku-shin ( a direct retainer of the bakufu ) became a kanjoginmiyaku officer , he was ranked at rokui ( the sixth rank ) , being allowed to wear clothes called hoi .
after the ashidakanosei law was enacted in the kyoho reforms , this post was the highest one that could be reached by lower-class officers of the bakufu , and it was rare that such an officer was promoted above this post .
** 0000 : this post was established .
** 0000 : this post was abolished .
** 0000 : this post was reestablished .
** 0000 : this post was separated into kujikata ( a post in charge of civil suits ) and kattekata ( a post in charge of financial affairs )
** 0000 : the number of officers in this post was increased , establishing the organization firmly .
** 0000 : this post was abolished .
** konoe no daisho
** konoe no daisho ( major captain of the palace guards ) is one of the government posts in the ritsuryo system .
konoe no daisho is ryoge no kan ( a post outside the original ritsuryo code created by imperial edicts ) .
one konoe no daisho was allocated to each of the left and right divisions to manage sayu konoefu ( the left and right divisions of the inner palace guards ) .
konoe no daisho is equivalent to jusanmi ( junior third rank ) , but it was considered higher than the actual rank .
usually , a minister or dainagon ( a major counselor ) additionally held this post , therefore its rank was often equivalent to or higher than jusanmi .
** konoe no daisho was the highest position among the permanent military officers .
after the muromachi period , seiitaishogun ( commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians , great , unifying leader ) often held konoe no daisho as well .
** otsukegaro ( a governmental post in the edo bakufu , or a person or persons in the post )
** the jobs
** otsukegaro at the gosanke families
** in the owari-tokugawa family
** in the kii-tokugawa family
** in the mito-tokugawa family
** otsukegaro other than those at the gosanke families
** in the edo period , the character of " 御 " ( indicating a honorific expression ) was added to its head , because this karo was appointed by shogun , but today the more simple term of tsukegato is used more often instead .
as many as more than ten persons were sometimes appointed to the post , but ordinarily this term was used for indicating the head of these karo .
in particular , five tsukegaro at the tokugawa gosanke families ( three privileged tokugawa branch families ) are famous .
** tsukegaro assisted the lord in political affairs and in military affairs , and was also responsible for bringing up the lord .
therefore , the feature of the status were more those of an inspector under the direct supervision of shogun than those of a retainer of a lord .
over time , the concept of tsukegaro came to depend on each domain and each tsukegaro family .
it appears that some tsukegaro served faithfully to the lord and confronted the shogun family , and others confronted the lord unnecessarily or engaged in factional strife in the domain .
** the hiraiwa clan ( in the inuyama domain , with a 000 , 000 koku of rice crop )

until the end of the bakufu after that , he managed the governmental affairs of the domain as the head karo of the echizen family .
when a kaieki punishment ( forfeit rank of samurai and properties ) was administered to tadanao matsudaira , he was wanted for the position of an independent daimyo .
however , he firmly declined to become officially independent saying that he was under an obligation of the mtsudaira family ( hideyasu , the first lord of the domain ) .
on the other hand , he was treated as a daimyo in the bakufu .
an edo residence was bestowed on him by the bakufu in asakusa ( later honjo )
in the celebrating or morning occasions at the shogun family , he made presents together with other daimyo .
when he worked in edo , it was customary that he presented himself in front of the shogun and received a present from the shogun , showing that he was treated almost as an independent daimyo .
however , in the haihan-chiken reform ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) , the honda family was treated as a baishin ( a retainer of shogun ' s retainer ) and was designated as shizoku ( family or person with samurai ancestors ) .
being reluctant to accept this situation , people in his former territory and his former retainers caused the takefu disturbance in 0000 , and he was included in kazoku ( peerage ) in 0000 , being awarded the status of baron in 0000 .

** gunji
** summary
** gunji under the ritsuryo system
** elimination of gunji
** gunji ( district manager ) was :
a local government official under the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
it is described below .
** one of family names in japan .
** gunji was a local government official who ruled a gun/kori ( a county ) under kokushi ( an officer of a province ) who was appointed from the central aristocracy under the ritsuryo system .
** due to the taika reforms , the ritsuryo system was officially introduced in japan , and the local system was also organized .
around 000 , the ' kuni ' ( an administrative unit ) administrated by local gozoku ( powerful local clans ) , i . e . , kuninomiyatsuko ( provincial governors ) , was abolished , and kori/hyo ( local administrative organization ) was implemented .
old kuninomiyatsuko were assigned to be chihokan ( local officials ) called kori no miyatsuko and kori no kami ( district chieftains ) .
( a district or provincial administration that emerged in the realm of great king kotoku )
** dairyo and shoryo who especially had high authorities were also called , ' gunryo ' ( hereditary district magistrates ) .
unlike kokushi who was appointed from the central government officials with a fixed term , gunji was appointed from local gozoku including old kuninomiyatsuko by heredity and was a lifelong official without a fixed term .
gunji was a special position which was based on the ritsuryo law but was not included in the government organization of the ritsuryo system .
** gunji not only had the right to collect taxes , but also had great authority to be in charge of : saving the taxes , paying taxes as tribute and using them , as well as controlling handen shuju ( a regulation of land ownership ) .
the local administration at the beginning of the ritsuryo system was a two-tiered administration by kokushi sent by the imperial court and by gunji having authorities as a local chief .
however , the imperial court started restructuring gun by dividing them and introducing go ( village ) in order to create gun as administrative units detached from the influence of gozoku .
moreover , when there were multiple gozoku in a gun , each gozoku was assigned to be gunji in turn so that one specific gozoku would not monopolize the position of gunji .
** shikibu-sho ( ministry of ceremonial ) exercised jurisdiction over the appointment and dismissal of gunji .
a gunji candidate recommended by kokushi had to visit shikibu-sho to have an interview before being appointed .
not everyone recommended by kokushi was assigned to be gunji , and this decision was made depending on the situation of the area .
although the most important factor in assigning gunji , according to the ritsuryo system , was personal ability , it was the record and line of clan and family of the candidate , called fudai ( hereditary ) that was actually prioritized .
kokushi was able to assign a temporary gunji ( called ginin gunji [literally , a quasi-appointed district manager] ) until an official gunji was assigned .
when an official gunji was appointed , ginin gunji naturally lost their position , but kokushi in some provinces were later given authority to increase the number of gunji temporarily , and those temporary gunji were also called ginin gunji .
** socially , gunji had traditional authority as well as enormous financial power , and maintained the order of local societies by relieving poor peasants as " influential local gozoku . "
** gunji conducted government affairs at a public office called gunga ( provincial office ) , but sometimes a private residence of gozoku who were assigned to be gunji was used as gunga .
such gunga was sometimes called guke/gunge/kooge .
** gunji had a lot of privileges such as receiving shikiden ( office-rice fields ) , sending their children to kokugaku ( provincial schools ) and allowing them to be kondei ( regular soldiers guarding kokubu [ancient provincial offices] or sekisho [checking station] ) .
** due to the stalemate of the ritsuryo system , a practical administrative reform was implemented around the middle of the 0th century .
also , in the provinces , the authority of kokushi was enforced in order for the imperial court to ensure the tax revenue .
accordingly , the authority of gunji was gradually absorbed by the authority of kokushi .
as a result , local gozoku who had been serving as gunji were required to change .
on the other hand , zaichokanjin ( the local officials in the heian and kamakura periods ) or executive local government officials , who had the authority of kokushi , became influential rapidly .
some local gozoku avoided the position of gunji , and chose to survive as zaichokanjin instead .
along with the reduction of gunji authority , gunga and guke were diminished .
moreover , the ancient-style gun , go and shoen ( manor in medieval japan ) were dissolved or reformed , and the medieval-style gun , go and shoen were established .
also , gozoku of old gunji started running myoden ( rice field lots in charge of a nominal holder ) , and became tato ( cultivators ) .
** metsuke ( a governmental post of the edo bakufu )
** summary
** metsuke is
** a governmental post of the edo bakufu .
** it was one of the posts that daimyo in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) established for checking the human heads , brought by their subordinates after a battle , for granting appropriate rewards .
** one ' s body part to which their opponent pays their special attention
** it is said that this term was originated in the persons who , in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , watched the states of soldiers , their leaders and enemies , and reported them to their lords .
** in the edo bakufu , the officers in this post watched for wakatoshiyori ( governmental officers in the bakufu ) the states of hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu ) and gokenin ( also direct retainers of the bakufu , but lower-ranked than hatamoto ) .
this post was established in 0000 , and the number of the officers was up to 00 .
posts similar to this were established in domains as well .
** a post called kachi-metsuke or hoko-metsuke was also placed to watch the fighting results and job statues of gokenin and ashigaru ( common foot soldiers ) .
** nyogo ( rank of court lady )
** nyogo was one of the ranks and titles of the imperial consorts in the pre-modern days of japan , and its role was to attend on the emperor in his bedroom .
the word ' nyogo ' originated from the book ' shurai , ' which described about the governmental organizations of china ( zhou ) .
the rank of nyogo followed kogo ( the empress ) and chugu ( the second consort ) .
** the word ' nyogo ' first appeared in the article about emperor yuryaku in ' nihonshoki , ' but in fact , ki no otona and kudaranokonikishi kyoho who were made nyogo during the reign of emperor kanmu were the beginning of nyogo .
the rank of nyogo was low at first but gradually raised , and after the middle of the heian period , it became customary that kogo ( empress ) was promoted from nyogo .
asako kujo ( eisho kotaigo ) who was nyogo of emperor komei , was the last nyogo .
** the number of nyogo ladies was not decided and when there were several nyogo ladies , they were called after the name of their quarter in the place , i . e . ' jokyoden nyogo ' ( a nyogo living in jokyoden ) .
** after the onin war , even consorts from the regent families tended to choose to remain in the nyogo rank , because it became difficult to put together a sum of money for the ceremonies that they had to have when they were promoted to chugu .
** oban-gashira or obanto
** oban-gashira or obanto have the following meanings :
** 0 . oban-gashira
indicating a governmental post in the edo bakufu , or the head of the oban that was an organization of soldiers .
** 0 . obanto
this was the honorific title for the banto who was placed at the highest post of all employees at a merchant house .
** banto
** banto
see the following for the historical usage of the term " banto . "
** the term existed as legal terminology in article 00 of japan ' s commercial code prior to its amendment in 0000 ( reorganized as article 00 after amendment ) .
the terms " banto " and " tedai " were used in the code as examples of persons , who were employed for business activity and commissioned under certain or specific provisions , but they were removed with the 0000 amendment .
** banto/bangashira ( samurai family )
under the oban gashira was the " oban kumigashira " who served as a middle manager .
** the bangashira was the highest ranking post in security during peaceful times and a commander at war , likewise in various feudal domains .
the bangashira also served as intermediary for retainers in the security division ( " bankata " ) to report their views to the feudal lord .
in some domains , the vassal with this authority was called " samurai-gashira " or " kumigashira " rather than bangashira .
in a domain with both kumigashira and bangashira posts , the latter was higher in rank , although this is not necessarily true for all domains .
there were instances in which the kumigashira ranked higher , such as when the kumigashira was a samurai daisho ( troop commander ) who was appointed to lead a cavalry .
** there are records describing sadayoshi okuno also as bangashira , which may be evidence that the terms bangashira and kumigashira were synonymous in the domain .
** the status of the bangashira in a domain varied in details by domains , ranking in importance after the chief retainers , toshiyori and churo ( middle-level retainers ) in some cases , and lower than yojin ( lord chamberlain ) in other cases .
notwithstanding , there is a clear trend in the order of rank of the bangashira in a feudal domain .
in a small domain or a domain with a simple administrative system , the vassal ranking below the chief retainer was the yojin .
in the small domain , the yojin supported the chief retainer in all matters and ranked higher than the bangashira .
in the small domain , the bangashira , rusui ( caretaker ) and koyonin may have been roughly similar in rank , or the bangashira may have ranked higher .
it was rare that the bangashira ranked higher than the edo rusui or the koyonin .
in the large domain , the bangashira ranked higher than the rusui and the koyonin .
in both small and large domains , the bangashira ranked higher than monogashira ( military commanders ) and kyunin ( upper class retainers ) .
** very roughly speaking , the bangashira was appointed from persons in the ' upper-middle class ' of vassals in each domain .
in times of peace , appointments were based on family lineage .
** banto ( mercantile house )
the banto in a mercantile family held the highest position among employees , especially during the edo period .
** the duties of the banto covered not only business management but also administrative affairs of the family and were allowed to wear haori ( japanese half-coat ) , which was not allowed for the tedai and others .
at many mercantile families , employees up to tedai rank were expected to live with the merchant and his family , so the employee in banto position was finally freed from this obligation and was allowed to commute from his own home .
also , marriage was not allowed until reaching banto status in many cases .
the banto may have been granted license from the employer to become independent and started his own business , but this was only possible after undergoing a struggle for survival and achievement of the banto status .
** hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata ( literally , " investigative division for arson and organized robbery )
** the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata post was for mostly cracking down such felonies as arson , robbers ( burglars ) and gambling .
originally , with this post being a temporary one , the officers in this post were selected from osakitegumigashira and mochigumigashira , both of which belonged to the standing army of the bakufu .
in historical dramas , this post or an officer in this post is sometimes called " katoaratame " or " kato . "
** summary
after the conflagration in the meireki era ( 0000 - 0000 ) , many arsonists and burglars appeared in edo .
therefore , the bakufu established the " tozokuaratame " post as the one dedicated for cracking down these serious crimes in 0000 .
after that , the " hitsukearatame " post was established in 0000 .
nakayama kageyu , who was feared as a " oni-kageyu " ( fiendish kageyu ) is known as the head of hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata officers .
however , in 0000 when the incident of raiding kira ' s residence occurred , the tozokuaratame post was restored , and the bakuuchiaratame post ( for cracking down gambling ) was newly established .
in the next year , the hitsukearatame post was restored .
in 0000 , the tozokuarateme post and the hituskearatame post were integrated into the " hitsuke-tozoku-aratame " post , with the post assumed by sente-gashira ( the head of sentegumi ( a group of persons guarding edo ) additionally .
however , this post became independent of sente-gashira in 0000 .
the jobs of the bakuuchiaratame post were transferred to the town magistrate post , in the year when the " hitsuke-tozoku-aratame " post was introduced .
** with no specific office provided , the residence of sentegumi-gashira , for example , was used as the office .
the organization of the sente-gumi ( consisting of five to ten yoriki officers ( assistants ) and 00 to 00 doshin offices ( placed under yoriki ) ) was used as it was .
however , persons having lots of experience in the cracking-down operations sometimes remained in the post even after the head of the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame " post changed .
meakashi ( persons hired temporarily ) were also used as in the town magistrate ' s office .
nobutame hasegawa , who assumed the post from 0000 to 0000 , is famous .
** the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata post was provided with the right to investigate crimes , such as theft , burglary , and arson , but with almost no jurisdiction .
therefore , when making a judgment for a suspect who should have been administered to a punishment above the tataki punishment ( basically , beating ) , the matter had to be submitted for the judgment of roju ( the second-highest post in the bakufu government ) .
the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata officers belonged to the bankata ( guardians ) , who were military officers , and therefore , their cracking-down operations were relentless and were feared by the general public .
it is recorded that they were disliked by the officers at the town magistrate offices who were engaged in investigations of crimes .
perhaps due to such a situation , villain ' s roles were often assigned to them , for example , in period dramas .
** the head of the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata post was also in charge of kayakukata-ninsokuyoseba , which was the facility to correct criminals ' behaviors and to train them for jobs .
however , except heizo hasegawa , the first manager of ninsokuyoseba , the manager was placed under the town magistrate as yoseba-bugyo , the head of an organization separated from the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata post .
** history of the establishment of the post
the town magistrate officers belonged to the yaku-gata group consisted of civil officers , and the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata officers belonged to the ban-gata group consisted of military officers .
in addition , criminals often set fire on the building after committing a crime in it to disrupt the investigation .
therefore , this post was established as the riot police that could crack down these criminals with arms and was provided with investigation right as well .
** the abolishment of and the reestablishment of the post
the hitsuke-tozoku-aratame-kata officers were permitted to take any questionable person into custody forcibly , even if the person was an ordinary person in towns , a samurai or a priest .
therefore , many adverse effects , for example , of arresting a wrong person due to relentless cracking-down operations , , were caused , and therefore , the post remained abolished for a while but was reestablished in 0000 .
it is said that two honyaku-kayaku ( kayaku means a temporary post to be assumed additionally ) officers ( with a term of one year ) and two tobun-kayaku officers ( with a term of half of a year ) were employed customarily .
the tobunkayaku officers were appointed to the post in the autumn - winter season when many fires occurred .
in addition , the number of these officers was sometimes increased under chaotic situations , for example , when destructive riots occurred frequently in the edo city area .
in 0000 , the post became the one to be assumed independently , not to be assumed additionally as well as temporarily .
** eiten
** eiten in japan
** eiten ( honor ) is a generic term for treatment , positions and titles that the nation gives as a commendation to a person who has rendered distinguished service to the nation and the public .
eiten also refers to its system .
usually , a commendation is given to a person when his/her honor is certified by the nation , and in some cases , privileges and special treatment appertain to the commendation , like ikai ( court rank ) or peerage of the medieval period .
at a diplomatic ceremony between nations , the seat arrangement was determined depending on whether the person has a decoration or a peerage , and what grade he/she was at .
in japan before the second world war , 00 ranks and 00 kinds were set as in-palace seat ranks defined in the imperial ceremony ordinance .
** the conferment of eiten was one of the important authorities of the emperor , and all eitan were conferred by the emperor as a formality . .
even the lower rank like kun hachito ( the 0th order of merit ) whose kunki ( decoration diploma ) does not have the name of the emperor in it , was described to be " conferred by the emperor . "
the constitution of the empire of japan stipulates this emperor ' s sovereign authority to award honors as one of the emperor ' s powers , while the constitution of japan also stipulates it as one of the emperor ' s constitutional functions .
although the emperor is not involved , the people ' s honor award and the prime minister ' s award established in 0000 are also considered as one of eiten .
** change
the decoration system in japan was started when 賞牌従軍牌制定ノ件 ( the establishment of the prize-medal and war-medal system ) ( dajokan fukoku [the proclamation by the grand council of state] no . 00 ) was established on april 00 , 0000 .
the decoration established at that time became the base of the current kyokujitsusho ( the order of the rising sun ) .
** the order of the chrysanthemum was established in 0000 .
** in the ordinance of medals ( dajokan fukoku no . 00 ) issued in december 0000 , the medal with red ribbon , the medal with green ribbon and the medal with blue ribbon were established , and the conferment of medals was started .
** in 0000 , the order of the sacred treasure and the orders of the precious crown were established .
** in 0000 , the decoration only for military personnel , kinshi kunsho ( the order of the golden kite ) was established .
afterward , more kinds of medals were added .
** in 0000 , the conferment of bunka kunsho ( the order of culture ) was started .
** with the end of world war ii , the bestowal of an order for survivors was once suspended , but was resumed in 0000 .
** when the decoration system was thoroughly revised in 0000 , the grading with number was abolished and the decoration standard was also reviewed .
during this discussion , the abolishment of the medal system , which had been criticized for overlapping with the decoration system , was considered but postponed .

** yoriki ( a governmental post in the edo bakufu )
** in the medieval period
** in the early-modern times
** yoriki was a typical governmental post in the edo bakufu .
yoriki ( 与力 ) was sometimes written as 寄騎 , but the meaning of 与力 and that of 寄騎 depended on the era .
** before the edo period , in order to organize sonae ( back-up army ) , this term was also used for indicating a middle-class samurai , such as a head of ashigaru ( foot soldiers ) having themsleves under the control of an influential samurai .
** in the kamakura period , both 与力 and 寄騎 were used simply refer to back-up soldiers , but later , these terms came to be more often used for indicating the lower-class samurai who followed daimyo or influential millitary commanders .
** it was not rare that these territoty owners possessed land worth several thousand kanmon ( kanmon : monetary unit at that time ) .
** furthermore , there were the yoriki-daimyo who were subordinated by a larger daimyo to reinforce his power .
as a typical such example , toshiie maeda was subordinated by katsuie shibata .
** daimyo in the sengoku period racked their brains to prevent rebellion , considering that , when yori-ko ( 寄騎・寄子 ) , territory owners were allowed to be integrated into yori-oya ( 寄親 ) , the power of the yori-oya could become too big . .
** in particular , these tactics were often seen in the gohojo clan , the imagawa clan , and the uesugi clan .
** in the edo bakufu , yoriki were posted together with doshin ( officers under yoriki ) to assist their senior officers . .
in particular , machi-kata yoriki under machi-bugyo ( the post in charge of townspeople ' s affairs or officers in the post ) was famous , assisted machi-bugyo , and played the functions of administration , judicature , and police .
in addition to ordinary yoriki who belonged to bugyo-sho , there were also uchiyori who were private retainers of machi-bugyo .
it could be considered that a yoriki was the head of a police station .
** yoriki was allowed to ride on a horse , and top-class yoriki officers earned a two hundred and several tens of rice crop , surpassing lower-class hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu ) .
however , yoriki were not allowed to have audience with shogun nor to enter the edo castle .
** for a yoriki officer , a residence with around 000 tubo ( approximately 0 . 0 square meters/tubo ) of premises was given .
** shomotsu-bugyo ( a governmental post of the edo bakufu )

** kanshoku ( government post )
** summary
** kanshoku ( government post ) means the posts of government officials .
specific classification will be shown below .
incidentally , kani is the court rank that is completely different from kanshoku .
the name of each kanshoku is kanmei .
** kan and shoku
kan means general kinds of duties , and shoku means specific scopes of duties to be undertaken .
** kanshoku is a certain duty allocated to each government official , and a position filled by the government official with responsibility .
in japan , the word kanshoku is used for full-time and part-time officials mainly in the administration branch and the judicial branch , and seldom used in the legislative branch .
in the united states , an example of government officials in the judicial branch is the aides to representatives .
** kanshoku means kan , which is general classifications of duties undertaken by government officials , and shoku , which is specific subclassifications of duties .
** kanshoku is the positions in government organizations .
** being appointed to kanshoku is ninkan , and retired from kanshoku is taikan or jikan .
being dismissed from kanshoku is menkan .
committing bribery to get kanshoku is baikan or ryokan , the tendency of which was especially seen in the feudal japan .
** the system of kanshoku is also called shokusei .
** in present japan , when part-time government officials are recruited , the title of the office and treatment for the officials are notified as saiyo yotei kanshoku in most cases .
** otoshiyori
** the job and position
** rank status
** relationships with joro-otoshiyori
** major otoshiyori
** otoshiyori was a female servant post ( or also indicated the servant herself ) in o-oku ( the inner halls of edo castle where the wife of the shogun and her servants resided ) in the edo period , and was often called rojo as well .
the post was placed in a rank of ' omemie-ijo ' which was allowed to see shogun and his wife in person .
there was a similar post for female servants working in inner halls of a samurai residence .
however , descriptions here are made only for otoshiyori in o-oku .
** basically , there were otoshiyori to seii taishogun ( literally , " the great general who was to subdue the barbarians " ) and otoshiyori to his wife .
however , depending on the era , there was otoshiyori to a princess of the shogun family or otoshiyori to shogun ' s real mother .
for example , otoshiyori egima in the ejima-ikushima incident was otoshiyori to gekko-in , the real mother of ietsugu tokugawa , the seventh shogun .
the power and social status of otoshiyori was dependent on the era , but it is said that the rank of otoshiyori to shogun was basically placed above those of other otoshiyori .
** the jobs were done in a yearly rotation and in a monthly rotation .
when an otoshiyori served for a month in the monthly rotation , she entered ' chidorino-ma ' ( literally , plover room ) in the gotenmuki area around 00 am , and summoned female servants , directing everything there without going out of the room .
the otoshiyori is said to have exited from the room around four pm .
by the way , the otoshiyori to shogun ' s wife did her job not in the ' chidorino-ma ' room but in ' rojoshu-tsumesho ' ( literally , the room for female servants ) near to the wife ' s residence .
in the latter half of the edo period , a post named " goyogakari " was established to handle , for example , private talks with governmental officers working in the chu-oku area .
** one of female servants ' duties in the inner halls was yotogi for shogun ( to sleep with shogun ) .
when shogun selected one of his wife ' s ochuro , it was customary that the otoshiyori to shogun negotiated with the otoshityori to shogun ' s wife .
** in the later edo period , some concubines of shogun were given ' otoshiyori-kamizakaku ' ( literally , the head otoshiyori level ) .
however , this did not mean that such females were appointed to the otoshiyori post .
as described above , the person to sleep with shogun was selected from ochuro servants .
when the servant became pregnant after sleeping with shogun , she came to be considered a ' concubine , ' but her rank status remained ochuro .
it is sad that ' otoshiyori-kamizakaku ' was given to the servant for making her treatment equivalent to that of otoshiyori or joro-otoshiyori ( the highest female servant post in o-oku ) in salary and rank status .
** ichinosoku , ' the place with the highest status of ' nagatsubone ' ( attendants ' quarters ) , where female servants in o-oku resided , was allocated to otoshiyori .
it is said that " ichinosoku " was provided with a space of around 00 tatami mats .
it is also said that the place was divided into around ten tatami-mat rooms , with a lavatory , bath room and kitchen as well .
it is said that the status in going out of the castle was equivalent to that of a person with a 000 , 000 koku of rice crop .
it is said that a high-class female servant employed persons called ' heyakata , ' and chore-men called ' gosai ' who did her private chores , such as shopping outside the castle instead of her .
it is said that an otoshiyori mostly employed more than ten ' heyakata ' persons .
** female servants from a kuge ( court noble ) family , accompanying a female who was from a kuge family and married to shogun , were appointed to the joro-otoshiyori post , the highest post for female servants in o-oku .
the joro-toshiyori servants played the role of advisers to shogun or shogun ' s wife , and managed ceremonies and rituals in o-oku .
coming form kuge families , they were provided with no political power , and it is said that they confronted otoshiyori servants who were from hatamoto ( a direct retainer of the bakufu ) samurai families .
however , it is said that the o-oku female servant system became disorganized towards the end of the bakufu period , and that anekoji in the era of ieyoshi tokugawa , the twelfth shogun , was largely involved in governmental operations of the bakufu as well .

** in the sekkan-ke ( the families which produced the regent and the chief adviser to the emperor ) , nyobo and keishi ( household superintendent ) took the role of moushitsugi , and this custom was inherited by the shogun families in the military governments .
aside from this , a position called kanto moshitsugi ( court-appointed liaison with the bakufu ) was created in the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
kanto moshitsugi reported the requests from the kamakura bakufu and negotiated with the bakufu regarding the important government affairs , together with moshitsugi .
later , the saionji family was , by heredity , appointed to kanto moshitsugi , and they gained a greater voice than the sekkan families in the imperial court .
in the muromachi bakufu , the families who mediated for seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) , were limited to several specific families called moshitsugishu ( a civil servant post in muromachi shogunate ) .
also , other than sekkan families , moushitsugi was placed at monzeki ( temples formerly led by founder of sect , temples in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family ) and gozan ( zen temples highly ranked by the government ) .
in the sekkan families , moshitsugi was appointed to tenjobito ( a high-ranking courtier allowed into the imperial palace ) who served as keishi or kaboku ( a man servant ) , and at gozan , it was appointed to inryouken house-hold .
** the word ' soja ' first appeared in the heian period , but was more often seen in the muromachi period .
moushitsugi and soja are used in the same meaning ( " nippo jisho " [japanese-portuguese dictionary] defines shoja , moushitusgi and toritsugite [a person in charge of informing a shogun or daimyo of the name of visitors to the residence before a meeting] as synonyms ) .
' soja ' was exclusively used in the oda government , the toyotomi government and edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , all of which rose to the central authority from the sengoku daimyo .
in the edo bakufu , fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the tokugawa family ) was mainly appointed to sojaban ( an official in charge of the ceremonies ) , and was simply called ' soja , ' and in charge of the duties of moushitsugi .
** yunonagashi ( a government post in ancient japan )
** yunonagashi was a government post established in japan during the asuka period and took charge of managing tomokuyu ( also known as yu no mura ) that was a territory of the imperial family .
** " nihonshoki " vol . 00 , what is called ' jinshinki ' is the record of the whole year of 000 , the first year of the reign of emperor tenmu , and the most of the description is about the jinshin war .
in that description , yunonagashi appears twice and tomoku appears once .
** on 00 , oama no miko , who was leading the army to ise , ran into 00 horses from ise province , carrying rice harvested in tomoku , near gunke in uda gun ( later uda gun . )
on 00 , oama no miko was met by miyyake no iwatoko , who was kuninotsukasa no kami , miwa no kobito who was suke , and tanaka no tarimaro , who was yunonagashi , and takata no niinomi at gunke in suzuka kori in ise province .
** tomokuyu was a system that had long existed from the ancient china , and in the han dysnasty , the lands were given to the members of the imperial family , excluding the lords and kings , for their own income sources .
however , the system didn ' t exist in the tang dynasty in 000 ; therefore , it is considered that japan adopted the system from the han dynasty system through book ( s ) .
in the later japanese ritsuryo legal code system , tomokuyu was given to chugu and togu and the tomoku system was the same as the fuko system except for the name .
** the only historical source that described about yunonagashi was ' jinshinki ' , and yunonagashi appeared neither in the chinese history nor in the japanese history in the later ages .
from that fact , it is inferred that yunonagashi was established during the reign of emperor tenji , immediately before the jinshin war , and abolished shortly after .
that oama no miko ordered yunonagashi who was at a distance from his residence to first raise the army shows the close ties between oama no miko and yunonagashi .
it is considered that the two yunonagashi oo no honji and tanaka no tarimaro were the heads of tomokuyu established for oama no miko .
besides , some scholars consider that yunonagashi was a government post appointed by the court , and some scholars consider that yunonagashi was appointed by oama no miko for his own territory .
** rusui ( a governmental post placed in the edo bakufu and in domains )
** rusui in the bakufu
** rusui was a governmental post placed in the edo bakufu and in domains .
it was also called orusui .
** rusui officers of domains were also called oshirozukai ( literally , an officer at the castle ) in edo , established a rusui association approved by the bakufu to exchange information , and therefore , they were so-called diplomats of domains .
** in a few domains , the rusui officer , being responsible for guarding the lord residence in edo while the lord was absent from there , and the oshirozukai liaison officer were placed separately .
** a deputy rusui officer or an assistant to a rusui officer was often called rusui-soeyaku .
** selected from hatamoto ( direct retainers of the bakufu ) , each of the officers earned a 0 , 000 koku of rice crop ( approx . 000 liters/koku ) for the post , being the highest level available for hatamoto .
in the early edo period , the " o-rusui " post for the leader of the rusui officers was established , for which the highest social status available for hatamoto was given .
however , as the occasions when a shogun became absent from the edo castle diminished and power was transferred to lower-level posts due to the improvement of the bakufu system , the social status level of this post declined .
in around the genroku era ( 0000 - 0000 ) , this post became a honorary one for the hatamoto who were loyal to the bakufu for a long period of time .
** it should be noted that there was a similarly named post of rusuiban .
the officers in this post , being under control of roju as rusui officers , guarded o-oku over night and did chores in the o-oku area .
hatamoto with roughly 0 , 000 koku of rice crop were appointed to this post .
the officers in this post were associates of those in rusui post , but they were not in the master-servant relationship .
** rusui in domains
many of the rusui officers in domains were selected from competent retainers in the monogashira ( military commanders ) class ( the banto ( head of a group ) class in smaller domains )
** the rusui officers were responsible for guarding the domain residence in edo while the lord was absent from the residence .
furthermore , with so many behavioral styles , so called " three hundred etiquette styles and three thousand ritual styles , " established in the edo period , it was considered that the largest importance should be placed on following precedents correctly
to search for the precedents supporting the practice , information was exchanged among these officers in the rusui association .
it was also a role of rusui in domain to make communications and adjustment between the main domain and its branched domain
** hating secret maneuvers by rusui officers of domains , the bakufu prohibited them from entering the edo castle several times , but the prohibition was released each time soon because the measure caused inconvenience .
this fact would reveal their delicate position .
** rusui officers exchanged information frequently at yukaku ( red-light districts ) or restaurants , neglecting the financial situations of their domains .
therefore , their behaviors were viewed indignantly by their domains suffering from financial difficulties or by the financial officers concerned .
** when a domain had its own residence in kyoto , osaka , or nagasaki , rusui officers were mostly placed in these residences as well .
** zuryomei ( honorary titles )
** zuryomei were unofficial names for government posts .
** they were unofficial names for government posts which the imperial court and temples allowed merchants and traders , coming in and going out of the court and temples , to use .
** zuryomei given by the imperial court and temples
** merchandise dealt by merchants and traders with the zuryomei was more valuable as a brand and traded at the most extraordinary price among the merchandise made by craftsmen in the same industry .
therefore , many merchants and traders sought the zuryomei for their honor and prosperous trade .
** especially for the imperial court and temples which were exhausted by maelstroms of war and grabs for shoen ( manor in medieval japan ) made by samurai families , to grant official rank and the zuryomei was an essential source of income .
** zuryomei in samurai families
** after the muromachi period , shugo daimyo started the custom of granting unofficial names of government post without official ikai ( court rank ) and jimoku ( appointment ceremonies ) from the imperial court , to vassals and hikan ( low-level bureaucrats ) who had made military exploits .
these unofficial names were the zuryomei .
in many cases , the zuryomei was given to kokujin ( local samurai ) and busho ( japanese military commanders ) who were under the control of daimyo ( japanese feudal lords ) and also had a castle , territory and military strength .
when the zuryomei was given by a lord , written appointment to a government service called kanto no kakidashi , zuryo no kakidashi , kantojo or the like was issued , which was respected as an honor representing a social status and fame of samurai family .
** ikoku keigobanyaku ( military service )
** summary

** after the bunei war , it was build up in preparation for the invasion of yuan ( dynasty ) again .

** jikatasanyaku was a generic name for village officers in the early-modern times of japan ( the edo period ) .

** hakucho ( the ordinary people or inferior servants )
** japan
** korea
** hakucho is a term referring to male ryomin ( ordinary people ) with no special rank or title and no public employment in the chinese and japanese ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) .
people with no special rank or title were called hakucho ( ' haku ' means white in kanji [chinese character] ) since they wore not colored clothes but white ones .
** hakucho was called ' hakutei ' under the japanese ritsuryo system .
** among them , an illegitimate child with naii eighth or higer rank and a son of gunji ( local magistrates ) had a qualification to be a guard , however , others received the same treatment as hakutei who was a citizen with no rank and title .
** ( also , examples of a special conferment of a court rank were investiture by chikusen-joirei ( an ordinance to ordain a court rank to someone who saved a certain amount of money ) , contribution of property or reporting auspiciousness . )
later these rules became invalid .
** in addition , even if they worked as zatsumu ( a person who did routine tasks ) of government official , they were not exempt from taxes such as soyocho ( taxes in kind or seervice ) as long as they were hakutei .
** there are three main theories , which are mythology , different ethnic groups and political prisoners , about the origin , however , the theory of the different ethnic groups is the best guess of the three .
it is believed that hakucho was originated from tatar of central asia who naturalized in goryeo and faced discrimination since they repeatedly pillaged in the political confusion .
** the class discrimination which hakucho faced in korean peninsula was as follows .
** prohibited to hold zokufu ( record of family lines in china and korea ) .
** prohibited to take jobs except slaughter , meat merchants , leather products industry , bone craft and willow craft .
** prohibited to marry common people .
** prohibited to live in sunshiny places or highlands .
** prohibited to live in a house with a tiled roof .
** prohibited to learn writing and go to school .
** prohibited to use languages except honorific language to people with other social status .
** prohibited to have a family name .
** prohibited to visit public places .
** prohibited to use a coffin at the funeral .
** prohibited to use a tub at the wedding .
** prohibited to dig a grave in higher places than common people ' s grave and in the sunshiny places .
** prohibited to build a gravestone .
** prohibited to walk tall in front of common people .
** if they broke these rules , they were given a severe punishment and at times beaten up to death .
in that case , the killer was not punished at all .
this is because hakucho was considered as nonhuman .
** hakucho generally lived in a group in a remote area outside cities or villages and mainly took jobs such as slaughter , leather products industry and willow craft .
hakucho was not allowed to marry common people and their residential area was also restricted .
in addition , they were not allowed to use expensive daily commodities .
they had been prohibited from being engaged in agriculture and trade , however , this regulation was relaxed in the middle of joseon dynasty , so it seems some of them were engaged in the agriculture .
meanwhile , hakucho was not included in the family register and exempt from paying a tax or gunpu ( a tax to be paid instead of conscription ) since they were social outcasts who were not put under national control .
it is in contrast with nuhi ( slave ) controlled by the nation .
** some of them were freed from the hakucho rank , which was called mensen , but it was rarely done .
naturally , some people insisted that ' hakucho is also human ' and waged the freedom movement , however , as a result , they also suffered from discrimination as ' new hakucho ' .
after gabo reform carried out during the reign of gao zong , some people were freed from the social status as hakucho and became government official , but the discrimination against them consistently remained .
in 0000 , chosenkoheisya ( korean social organization ) was established to eliminate the discrimination against hakucho and waged the movement to eliminate the class difference along with the zenkoku suiheisha ( the national levelers ' association ) in japan .
according to the statistical investigation carried out in 0000 by chosen sotoku-fu ( korean government-general ) , hakucho who existed in korean peninsula at that time were 0 , 000 families and 00 , 000 people .
regarding the percentage of occupations , the most common occupation was animal food distributive trade , whose percentage was 00 . 0 percent .
added a set of occupation related to cows such as slaughter , leather products industry , shoe industry to the above , it became 00 . 0 percent .
the agriculture was 00 . 0 percent .
the willow craft was 00 . 0 percent .
the running of restaurants and low-grade inns was 0 . 0 percent .
** democratic people ' s republic of korea ( north korea ) says that ' under the socialism , hakucho issue has already been solved ' however , the sense of discrimination is persistent as they accused the president of republic of korea of being ' human hakucho ' .
** mokushi
** although each of the officers was a farmer , he was permitted to ride on a horse , to own his family name and to wear a sword , being the highest-positioned person of farmers .
because there were many ranches in the northen part of chiba prefecture , lots of information aboutmokushi is available there .

** however , in the heian period , the role of naiki was gradually reduced .
naiki was in charge of recording the official activities of the emperor , and was not qualified to enter dairi , the emperor ' s residence .
besides , as geki , the officials in charge of drafting the orders from daijokan , expanded their authority and absorbed the duty of drafting the imperial messages , naiki lost their roles .

** summary
** monjo hakase taught history to monjo-sho ( students of histories ) , which included such subjects as chinese classical literature and chinese official history .
its tang name was 翰林学士 ( which is pronounced kanrin-gakushi in japanese ) .
** the status of monjo hakase was initially regarded as equivalent to the official court rank of shoshichiinoge ( senior seventh rank , lower grade ) corresponding to that of an assistant teacher of myogyo-do .
two years later , myobo-sho ( subject of law ) and monjo-sho ( subject of history and chinese literature ) were recruited on april 00 , 000 , and as a result , these subjects became virtural independent subject each .
** in japan , however , literature and history attracted more interest due to their approachable nature than philosophical study ( myogyo-do ) and administrative study ( myobo-do ) did .
as a result , the status of monjo hakase came to rise as illustrated by omi no mifune ' s assuming office as daigaku no kami ( the principal of daigaku-ryo ) and as monjo hakase at the same time in 000 .
additionally , shikiden ( a rice field given to senior bureaucrats based on office ) for monjo hakase was increased from 0 cho ( 0 cho under the ritsuryo system equaled to 00 , 000 sq . m . ) to 0 cho in 000 .
** the most outstanding group of people among them was the sugawara clan founded by sugawara no kiyokimi who established monjoin ( one of the privately owned dormitories/lecture halls located in daigaku-ryo ) in around the middle of the ninth century .
michizane , who had risen to become minister of the right , however , fell in the shotai incident ( an incident in 000 in which michizane was defamed by fujiwara no tokihira and relegated to a government office known as dazaifu in kyushu ) .
additionally , both sugawara no takami and sugawara no atsushige , who have been implicated in the incident and appointed respectively daigaku no kami and monjo hakase after returning to the capital , died at an early age .
the sugawara clan ' s monopoly of kiden-do failed because of these incidents .
** the oe clan , as a result , deprived the sugawara clan of half the latter ' s control over monjoin through a monopoly on the monjo hakase posts , which even the sugawara clan could not achieve .
the presence of the fujiwara clan in kiden-do , however , was also quite remarkable after the appointment to monjo hakase of fujiwara no sugane ( the southern house of the fujiwara clan ) and fujiwara no sukeyo ( the ceremonial house of the fujiwara clan ) .
especially , the fujiwara clan owned kangakuin , one of daigaku-besso ( private dormitories/lecture-halls located in daigaku-ryo ) , which was believed to have been established in rivalry with monjoin , and worked , en masse , to enhance the family ' s presence in the educational scene .

** jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) ( a rank in japan )
** before and in the edo period
** in and after the meiji period
** the term " jugoi " ( junior fifth rank ) refers to an ikai ( court rank ) or a shinkai ( ranks granted to shinto gods ) in japan .
it ranks below shogoi ( senior fifth rank ) , above shorokui ( senior sixth rank ) .
if it was conferred posthumously , it is referred to as zo jugoi ( jugoi conferred posthumously ) .
those who belonged to jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) or a higher rank were regarded as nobles in the japanese court rank system before the meiji period .

** goi ( fifth rank ) was a rank corresponding to kokushi ( provincial governor ) , chinjufu shogun ( commander-in-chief of the defense of the north ) and shodaibu ( aristocracy lower than kugyo ) in the ritsuryo system .
those who belonged to jugoinoge or a higher rank were called ' tsuki ' ( 通貴 ) , and those who belonged to jusanmi ( junior third rank ) or a higher rank were called ' ki ' ( 貴 ) .
goi was divided into senior and junior subdivisions , each of which was further divided into upper and lower grades .
accordingly , goi ranged from jugoinoge ( junior fifth rank , lower grade ) to shogoinojo ( senior fifth rank , upper grade ) .
thus it may be said that it was necessary for nobles in the heian period to belong to jugoinoge or a higher rank .
** while another name of jugoinoge was eishaku ( the title of honorable position or honorable noble class ) , those who belonged to this rank were referred to as daibu ( master ) .
the first qin emperor in china conferred the rank of daibu , which corresponded to jugoi in japan , on a pine tree .
for this reason , jugoi corresponding to daibu was also referred to as shoshaku ( 松爵 ) ( literally , " peerage of a pine tree " ) .
therefore , conferring jugoinoge was referred to as joshaku ( conferring a peerage ) .
** this rank was conferred on many middle-class nobles including the above-mentioned clan members .
** in the muromachi period , it was also an ikai conferred on members of ashikaga shogun family or shugo ( provincial constable ) as the first investiture .
this rank was also conferred on many shugo , powerful kokujin ( local samurai ) and others .
** although the court rank of jugoi was conferred on the honda clan from the kaga domain , the corresponding post was not given to it .
therefore , members of the clan were called ' jugoi sama ' or ' jugoi dono ' ( both terms mean literally " mr . jugoi . " ) .
** jugoi had been automatically conferred on an eldest legitimate son of the peerage since the meiji period .
for this reason , an eldest legitimate son of the peerage was also referred to as jugoi .
this rank was also conferred on lieutenant colonels and others .
** at present , it is to be conferred on the deceased as a mark of honor .
it is conferred on the deceased who rendered distinguished service as chairperson of a prefectural assembly , head of a school , chief of police , fire chief , chief of a fire company or president of a company .

** the nara peerage
** summary

** after the restoration of the imperial rule , the meiji government emphasized on shinto as a japanese indigenous religious belief and employed opinions from scholars of japanese classical literature to create a principal of the separation of buddhism and shintoism .
this is the so-called nara peerage .
** there was a difference in treatment between the fujiwara clan and the others in the nara peerage .
after exclaustration , fujiwara clan members became shinto priests for the kasuga-taisha shrine , becoming ujigami ( guardian gods ) and were syncretized with the kofuku-ji temple ; they then attained the status of the tosho family as an independent family branch .

** myobu
** or , a synonym ( or another name ) for inari-shin ( the god of harvest ) and its fox .
** summary
however in japan , although the name " myobu " was adopted , the content of the job of myobu was completely different from that in china .
( the male official and its naming corresponding to myobu in china was not adopted in japan . )
** myobu is specified in the article of nakatsukasasho ( ministry of central affairs ) in " shikinryo gige ( commentary on the law which stipulates duties of this ministries ) . "
a woman who is higher than goi ( fifth rank ) in the rank is called uchi no myobu ( a senior court lady ) , and a wife of an official who is higher than goi ( fifth rank ) in the rank is called ge no myobu .
however , myobu was not a government post but was a rank in serving official duties of the government official that she worked for , so that there was no corresponding official court rank , nor a fixed number .
in the case of a queen ( of imperial family ) , she was ranked in ikai even if she was not higher than goi ( fifth rank ) in the rank .
until the nara period , women working in the palace were called kyujin ( court lady ) including myobu , however , myobu was discriminated from kyujin after the heian period .

** kojunin ( 小十人 ) ( escort guards )
** summary
** the term " kojunin " refers to a post of the security and military division ( bankata [security officials] ) of the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
the term is said to have come from kojunin ( an attendant ) .
kojunin were bodyguards most of whom were foot soldiers gurading a shogun and his legitimate sons .
their duties were divided into three categories , i . e . the vanguard on a march or in a procession , senkenkeibitai ( advance army ) to be sent to a destination , and the security guard inside a castle .
** the title " kojunin " can be found in documents on the edo bakufu or domains , especially large domains .
the function of kojunin was to guard and defend a shogun ( or a domain lord ) and his legitimate sons .
foot soldiers played a central role in it .
they were the foot soldiers who were closest to their lord in wartime or on a march .
therefore , those who held this post had a relatively high social status among foot soldiers .
** those who held this post were on duty in hinoki no ma ( a japanese cypress room ) of edo-jo castle in time of peace to guard the castle .
when a shogun went out of edo-jo castle to visit nikko tosho-gu shrine , zojo-ji temple , kanei-ji temple , etc . in time of peace , it was the time to show their stuff .
they were busy on such occasions .
when a shogun went out , they served as advance foot soldiers in a shogun ' s procession or went ahead of him toward his destination as the advance to guard the area .
kojunin accompanied a shogun on a trip to kyoto and osaka in the beginning and the end of edo period
they also guarded nijo-jo castle , etc .
** kojunin were headed by kojunin gashira ( the head of kojunin ) or kojunin banto ( a general manager of escort guards ) .
the middle manager of kojunin was kojunin kumigashira ( a group leader of escort guards ) whose yakudaka was 000 bales of rice .
kojunin kumigashira often traveled on official business to a shogun ' s destination to survey the site .
kojunin gashira ( or kojunin banto ) and kojunin kumigashira were entitled to ride on horseback .
there were generally 00 kojunin gashira , 00 kojunin kumigashira and 000 kojunin banshu ( guards holding the post of kojunin ) in the edo bakufu , although each number differed from age to age .
** banshi ( a samurai serving as a guard in the edo period ) holding the post of kojunin was characterized by having a status equivalent to that of hatamoto , but no entitlement to ride on horseback .
kojunin banshu were often selected from those whose karoku ( hereditary stipend ) was approximately 000 bales of rice ( or koku ) .
if one assumed office as kojunin , yakuryo ( executive allowance ) corresponding to a salary for 00 persons was given to him in principle .
the sum total will come to more than 000 koku in chigyo ( the annual stipend ) .
** distinguished or fortunate gokenin ( immediate vassals of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods ) among the high-ranking gokenin receiving karoku ( hereditary stipend ) or their soryo ( heir ) were promoted to kojunin .
some of them were promoted to hatamoto .
family lineage was more priotized in selection of bankata in time of peace .
accordingly , very few gokenin were directly selected from those who guarded the route that a shogun took for kojunin .
** those who were the second and the third sons of guards of koshogumi and set up a branch family were admitted into kakaku kojunin gumi .
but kakaku kojunin gumi was abolished in the kyowa era .
after its abolition , those who had had kakaku of kojunin were integrated into kakaku koshogumi .
** shinban
** shinban is a post in a samurai family in the area of security and military affairs ( bankata )
in the peace of the edo period , it is a bankata post that merged the newly created function of guards to protect the shogun in his travels and the function of standing army .
** the shinbangashira who heads the shinban earned salary of 0 , 000-koku rice yield and was in some instances selected from hatamoto retainers who ranked in the 0 , 000-koku class .
the earnings of the average shinban retainer was 000-koku yield , lower by 00 koku compared to those in shoinban and koshoban but is distinguished for not being obliged to keep horses at all times .
however , the shinban was allowed to ride horses .
like the oban , promotion was limited .
** the title of the shinban is sometimes seen in domains , especially in large domains .
in addition to serving as standing army for the domain , the shinban very often escorted the lord in his travels for protection .
in satsuma domain , there was shinban as a name for social standing .
** uneme

some uneme gained emperor ' s favor and gave birth to the emperor ' s baby .
as the status of mother was also considered important in those days , the children born from uneme were mostly placed lower than the children of the powerful clans in the capital or the imperial family .
** uneme became a system by kokyu shokuin rei in taiho ritsuryo legal code .
it was written as below .
** although uneme were recruited from each province by a prescribed number indicated in the official document issued by nakatsukasasho , uneme were ' offered ' formally .
** requirement information for uneme was :
at the age of 00 to 00 ;
** should be a sister or daughter of those at the status of gunji or above ; and
** should be selected carefully by their figures .
** uneme belonged to ' uneme no tsukasa ' under kunaisho and 0 uneme were allocated to ' suishi ' , which was another branch of kunaisho , and 00 uneme were allocated to ' kashiwade no tsukasa ' , which was also another branch of kunaisho .
the prescribed number was 00 , but it is considered that the number included nyoju ( prescribed number was 000 ) , which was similar to uneme , and uneme to the princess .
according to gunborei of taiho ritsuryo legal code , uneme was to be raised from one third of counties across the country .
** according to the reform by emperor heizei , the system of offering uneme was abolished and accordingly ' uneme no tsukasa ' was abolished , and the remaining uneme became to belong to ' nuidonoryo . '
emperor saga restored ' uneme no tsukasa ' , but thereafter , uneme were selected from the daughters of the nobles in the capital and became a mere formality .
from the edo period , uneme were selected from court ladies only on the occasion of an emperor ' s enthronement ceremony .

it is a likely opinion that she was identical with 稲葉国造気豆女 ( inabano kuninomiyatsuko kimame no musume ) , who gave birth to fujiwara no hamanari , the first son of fujiwara no maro .
it is considered that she was from the same clan as inabano kuninomiyatsuko kiyonari no musume , who was loved by emperor kanmu .

she was from iitaka gun , ise province .
she lived so long that she served for six tenures of five emperors , emperor gensho , emperor shomu , emperor koken , emperor junnin , and emperor konin .

** unemematsuri

this episode was the motif of the noh song ' uneme . '
** tomei ( tang name )
** ( nakamaro himself had taken the title shibirei [director general of shibi institution] of the newly created shibi chudai [office handling the principal empress komyo ' s affairs] , namely kotaigogushoku [imperial household agency officer assigned to the household of queen mother] )
after nakamaro fell from the position in 000 , the titles were returned to the former names , however , the tang name was often used as another name or an elegant name of the government post .
various ryoge no kan ( posts outside the original ritsuryo code created by imperial edicts ) , which were created from the late nara period to the heian period , had tang names .
( the emperor saga who set the posts of ryoge no kan such as kurodo no to [head chamberlain] and kebiishi [officials with judicial and police powers] also idolized the tang culture . )
** these tang names do not completely match the office organizations originated in chinese successive dynasties , so that they cannot be always replaced by one-to-one correspondence .
therefore , some organizations overlapped in using the tang name ; to the contrary , there were many cases in which a single organization had multiple tang names .

the pike is thought to have some relation to a saibo ( wooden stick as a weapon ) used by the sohei ( warrior monk ) , and both are assumed to have a magical meaning against impurity .
** however , hinin at that period were different from hinin of after ages , and they were not only the subject to be discriminated but also the awesome existence .
** sakan ( kokushi )
** sakan was the fourth among the four official ranks of shitokan under the ritsuryo legal code system .
** the letter ' 目 ' for sakan indicates the fourth rank of kokushi , which corresponded to ' 主典 ' in the national government .
sakan was mainly in charge of recording the matters in the office and drafting official documents .
especially in the highest ryoseikoku called taikoku , daisakan and shosakan were established .
** sho no sansei ( three saints of calligraphy )
** sho no sansei are three masters of calligraphy .
** kukai
he is also one of san hitsu ( the three famous ancient calligraphers ) .
** sugawara no michizane

he is also one of san seki ( the three great brush traces ) .
** toei daio
** toei daio is one of the honoric titles for sanzan kanryo no miya .
amongst educated people with kanbun ( chinese classics ) knowedge in the edo period , he was called as such in kanbun style .
( refers to ' imperial princess in toeizan kanei-ji temple ' )
** also , the kanzu was called sanzan kanryo no miya because they were all from sanzan kanryo no miya or were imperial princes .
** the strategy had various names such as ' sanzan kanryo no miya , ' ' nikko no miya , ' ' ueno no miya , ' ' toei daio , ' and so on .
it was also called ' rinno-ji temple sama ' by the imperial court and the court nobles , ' nikko mikado no kami sama ' by the edo shogunate and samurai , and ' ueno no miya sama ' by the edo people .
it was also referred to as toei daio in kanbun .
** this governance continued for 00 generations .
the appointed leaders for the temples were : 0 people from kanin-no-miya , 0 people from fushimi no miya , 0 people from arisugawa no miya , and the others were all imperial princes .
** most of the appointed leaders lived in kanei-ji temple and stayed in nikko for three months per a year and some of them stayed in the kansai region .
** there were some exceptions in this succession , as there were some individuals who did not assume the tendai-zasu position , and 0 people out of 00 generations did not double as the tendai-zasu position due to premature deaths or short reign .
the last generation , imperial prince kitashirakawanomiya yoshihisa , was also one of those who had a short reign : he did not assume the tendai-zasu position due to the boshin war .
the kanzu ( leader ) of ueno toeizan kanei-ji temple and the chief priest of nikko-zan rinno-ji temple simultaneously resigned and assumed the other ' s position .
because the tendai-zasu position could be appointed by other buddhist monks , there were some phases in their reign periods that they were not being tendai-zasu .
** misunderstanding of tendai-zasu
** in other words , it was toeizan kanei-ji temple who controlled thetendai sect in the edo period but not enryaku-ji temple on mt . hiei .
therefore , ' tendai-zasu ' in this case , accurately means zasu ( a head priest ) of a temple called enryaku-ji temple on mt . hiei .
** the tendai-zasu position had a short reign and a quick turn-over .
this history is slightly complicated ; however , zasu of enryaku-ji temple on mt . hiei in the edo period were also called tendai-zasu by convention .
** feudal lords
** summary
** feudal lords in europe
** feudal lords in japan
** head family , ryoke , and kaihatsu-ryoshu
** feudal lords in the military government
** usurping of the power of the feudal lords by the jito
** usurping of the power of the feudal lords by the shugo
** feudal lord class after the sengoku period
** feudal lords in india and southeast asia
** the term " feudal lord " is used to refer to a person who holds feudal dominion over a certain area of land and its residents ( territory ) .
** feudalism was the form of government or local autonomy that was employed in feudal times , and the position of feudal lord was often hereditary .
in europe , as states were emerging as single entities during the transition from the medieval period to early modern times , many feudal lords were given positions as nobles in the state ' s political structure .
** feudal lords undertook these projects .
** in the course of time feudal lords were gradually detached from the people and handed down their dominance as the absolute authority ; however , some lords were better or so excellent that they were admired as wise rulers and became legends .
** kaihatsu-ryoshu ( local nobles who actually developed the land ) is a generic name for those who secured a territory by extensive reclaimed land development after the mid heian period , and who were originally influential peasants ( tato ) .
although privatization of rice fields was approved by kokuga ( provincial government office compounds ) , the definition of rights was unclear ; therefore , kaihatsu-ryoshu donated their reclaimed lands as shoen ( private estates ) to juryoso ( career provincial official class ) as shoen ( manors ) .
juryoso who managed to own a shoen in such a manner is called ryoke ( virtual proprietor of manor ) .
ryoke became increasingly more opposed to kokushi ( provincial governors ) who privatized kokugaryo , and donated their manors to kenmon seika ( powerful houses and influential families ) or large temples to seek protection while paying regular tax yields in return .
influential families or temples and shrines who accumulated manors in such a manner are called honke ( head family ) .
in the late heian period feudalism consisted of honke , ryoke , and kaihatsu-ryoshu .
kaihatsu-ryoshu also concurrently performed as zaichokanjin ( provincial government officers ) and they remained in the kokugaryo position when the relation with kokuga was more profitable .
** after the mid heian period , due to the monopoly of official ranks by fujiwara-hokke ' s ( the northern house of the fujiwara clan ) regents , many lower-ranking nobles fell out of work in the national political arena and went to the provinces .
there were many cases in which kaihatsu-ryoshu established a master-servant relationship with these nobles to resolve disputes over manors .
they sometimes armed themselves as samurai ( warrior ) while some lower-ranking nobles organized these warriors into armed groups ; they were often called toryo ( leader ) of the groups .
in the course of time the oshu fujiwara clan and the taira clan regime appeared from the leaders of samurai families , eventually forming the kamakura bakufu ( also known as shogunate , a japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) at the end of the 00th century .
** at first , installation of the jito position was limited to heishi mokkanryo ( land rights confiscated by kamakura bakufu from the taira family ) .
** throughout the kamakura period , jito ' s invasion to manors occurred frequently and disputes over land with manor lords intensified .
however , as a result , this accelerated jito ' s control over manors , which was contrary to the aim of the manor lords .
** shugo ( provincial constables ) were installed at the same time as jito ( 0000 ) , but they had a totally different role .
takauji ashikaga , who established the muromachi bakufu in kyoto in the first half of the 00th century , gave shugo a stronger authority to benefit himself from conflicts in the northern and southern courts ( japan ) period .
takauji gave shugo approval for karita-rozeki ( to reap rice illegally ) and the right to delegate judical authority to others besides taibon sankajo in the kamakura period .
moreover , other policies were conducted , including hanzei and manor management in provinces , which shugo had control over .
this was called the shugo-ryogoku system , and some shugo daimyo exercised a lot of power by taking charge of shugo in more than one province .
** however , the shugo position originally grew out of the bakufu ' s authority and the existence of shugo could have been threatened if this background collapsed for some reason .
this was why many shugo owned their residences in kyoto and sent shugodai ( deputy military governor ) to their posts .
since the shugo daimyo position was founded on various rights in manors , collapse of the manor system meant the loss of their economic base .
also , the master-servant relationship with warriors in the provinces did not grow out of territorial tranfers but of relations with commanding authorities in the military and the police .
one of the limitations that did not allow shugo to become feudal lords was the disturbance of the northern and southern courts in the muromachi period that led to the political instability and complications .
** the appearance of the feudal lord class which bore responsibility for local politics after the collapse of manorialism started in the sengoku period ( japan ) .
in the sengoku period , the master-servant relationship , in which the daimyo ruled as monarch , was developed with land as its base ; leading to the jigatachigyo system in the edo period ( provision of lands from a feudal government to retainers as salary ) .
** hideyoshi also conducted the sword hunt in 0000 to deprive the farming rank the right to wear a sword and to restrict the use of weapons which completed the heinobunri ( separation of the warrior class from the soil ) while creating the early-modern samurai rank .
samurai were permitted to adopt a surname and to wear a pair of swords , and was requiered to live in a castle town .
around that time , the study of family crests became popular among warriors .
** afterwards , the numbers of domains who retained the chigyo system ( enfeoffment system ) , accounted for 00% of all domains .
** satsumanokami
** summary
** satsumanokami was the post of kami ( chief ) of kokushi in satsuma province .
it presided over the state affairs including administration and jurisdiction .
the prescribed number was one .
the post corresponded to jugoi ( junior fifth rank ) .
it was one of juryomei ( allowance to be called with a special rank name adding his country name ) .
** after the name of the character in " heike monogatari " ( the tale of the heike ) , satsumanokami taira no tadanori , a person who steals a ride on a train or the like is colloquially called satsumanokami because tadanori is the homophone of fare cheating .
see ' fare cheating . '
** satsumanokami is one of the programs of kyogen .
** satsuma province was taikoku ( major province ) located in the area corresponding to the western part of present kagoshima prefecture .
during the edo period , the post was inherited by the shimazu clan that was the lord of satsuma province for generations while tadayoshi matsudaira was also appointed the post .
** there was a case that yoritsuna yazawa used the juryomei .
** joro otoshiyori
** duties and position
** joro otoshiyori is the title of women serving in the o-oku during the edo period .
the title is abbreviated as joro at times .
these women were allowed direct contact with the tokugawa shogun family and their wives and ranked the highest in o-oku .
** the joro otoshiyori is the official responsible for social , cultural and other important ceremonies and served as advisor to the shogun and his wife .
** many of the women who rose to the position came from noble families of kyo and were well-versed in court protocols , laws and special events and are believed to have accompanies the bride to wed the shogun and live in the edo castle .
** for this reason , lower-ranking toshiyori actually held the highest authority in o-oku , dominating all important and lesser matters .
** torimi
** principal posts
** torimi ( officer for falconry ) is a position in the edo shogunate .
the duties were to manage the falcon hunting grounds and to prepare for falcon hunting by the shogun .
falconry dates back to the medieval times when similar positions could be found in feudal domains .
** in contrast to the takajo ( hawker ) in charge of training the birds , the torimi was responsible for supervising the bird habitat in the hunting grounds in order to guide the shogun to locations with a high percentage of prey .
once a hunting ground was established , the torimi took charge of preventing poaching , feeding birds to become prey and mobilizing people from neighboring villages and securing safety .
because the torimi required extensive knowledge and experience in hunting , the post was regarded a skilled post and was very often hereditary .
** the sport was abolished under tsunayoshi tokugawa ' s edict prohibiting harm on living things but was restored and expanded under the reign of yoshimune tokugawa .
it was later abolished permanently in december 0000 when yoshinobu tokugawa decided to adopt the western military system .

** geki was one of the government posts belonging to daijokan , which was the highest organization of the imperial court under the ritsuryo legal code system .
it corresponds to sakan of shitokan .

the japanese reading of geki was ' tono ooishirusu tsukasa . '
** geki , placed under shonagon , took charge of revising the imperial edicts created by naiki of nakatsukasasho , and creating the documents to be presented from daijokan to the emperor .
geki , under the command of shokei of daijokan , also supervised the ceremonies and public affairs of the imperial court by examining precedents and submitting a report on them to contribute to smooth operation of the ceremonies and affairs as required .
further , geki partly took charge of the procedure of personnel affairs .
when kurodo was established and the authority of shonagon became a mere formality , part of duties and authority of shonagon were transferred to geki .
** as geki achieved so many duties , they rose to higher positions so that some geki were promoted to as high as fifth rank in the middle of the heian period .
these geki were called taifugeki .
later , the head of taifugeki was called ' kyokumu . '
the descendants of the branch families of the nakahara clan were not appointed daigeki but gondaigeki instead .
during the muromachi period , the descendants of the funabashi family began to serve as the instructor to the emperor to be promoted to shonagon without serving as geki for generations ; therefore , kyokumu was solely inherited by the oshikoji family .
during the edo period , the oshikoji family used the authority of kyokumu in mobilizing not only shisho but also jigekanjin in the respective ministries to perform ceremonies and public affairs of the imperial court .
it is considered that those jige kannin were counted more than 00 families and collectively called ' gekikata . '
** at first , they were the members of shonagonkyoku , which was the office of shonagon , but later , they began to have their own office called gekicho , which was called gekikyoku later .
gekicho was located to the east of kenshunmon gate to the emperor ' s residence , with a fudono building and the like built side by side .
meetings of daijokan were sometimes held in the building of gekicho and those meetings were called gekisei .

** kunin-chojakunin
** kunin-chojakunin is a post that existed in the edo period .
it was a hereditary post .
** summary
the name of the post derives from the job function as " a person performing fetid civic duty both day and night . "
** during a journey , the kunin-chojakunin was positioned at the right and left of the attendants in the second row of the parade , issuing warnings .
the post was subordinate to the dobo-kashira , with one appointed to the post with stipend for 00 persons
** tsuchida family
tsuchida family served this hereditary post from the time of fujiwara no yoritsune , the 0th shogun of the kamakura bakufu , and had been in service also of the ashikaga shogun family , nobunaga oda and hideyoshi toyotomi .
in the edo period , the post was established with service to ieyasu tokugawa .
from then on , the post has been filled by the tsuchida family , and even the name " magoemon tsuchida " was succeeded for generations .
for this reason , the post of kunin-chojakunin became synonymous with the name magoemon tsuchida .
the social status of the servant is believed to be servant to samurai warriors and not from the samurai class .
** the post has been held on hereditary basis by the tsuchida family since 0000 .
according to tsuchida family records , the hereditary post dates back to 0000 , when they served as attendant to shogun fujiwara no yoritsune on his travel from kyoto eastward .
** social status
there is little documentation regarding the kunin-chojakunin ( magozaemon tsuchida ) , although the attendant is believed not to be from samurai class but was servant to the samurai but at times is believed to have been a lower-ranking samurai or common folk .
the kunin-chojakunin was at least authorized to carry one small sword and to bear a family name .
** because the post was not an everyday function , it is unknown what the kunin-chojakunin did to make a living .

the post was abolished in march 0000 when yoshinobu was moved to the post of kinri goshuei sotoku ( post to guard kinri palace ) .
** tenka-bito
** origin of the word
** the definition of tenka-bito
** to become a tenka-bito , one should :
** requirements to be tenka-bito
** the end of the tenka-bito ' s history
** " tenka " is a concept , which originated in china that referred to the entire world ; it has been used in japan since ancient times .
the word " tenka " is seen on the roban ( dew basin at the bottom of a pagoda finial ) of asuka-dera temple established by soga no umako , which confirms that the word was already used in 000 .
since then , the word has frequently been used to the extent that government of an emperor is called " chitenka " ( rule the tenka ) .
** control the tenka ( world )
** the conditions for achieving the status of tenka-bito differ according to the period and the individual .
** however , the reason yoritomo was called tenka-bito is because he influenced the whole country through the firm master-and-servant relationship ( obligation and service ) with each samurai .
the same thing applies to takauji ashikaga .
** the tenka of nobunaga oda differs from that of yoritomo , takauji , and his successor hideyoshi .
nobunaga was aiming to unify the whole country under ' nobunaga oda ' s unification of japan policy , ' however , he suddenly died in the honnoji incident .
at the time of his death , he had only around 00 domains under control .
the reason he was regarded as ' the master of tenka ( tenka no nushi ) ' or ' mr . tenka ( tenka sama ) ' is because he controlled the center of japan , i . e . kyoto .
however , if he had not suddenly died in this incident , it is thought that he would have unified the whole country .
** establish of a samurai government
** it was only samurai who were called tenka-jin .
they were the people who established the samurai government by military power .
** behave as the vassals of the imperial court .
** tenka-bito took control of the government as the vassal of the imperial court .
it can be said that , by having the imperial family as their leader , they were in fact running the country .
as the samurai government came to prominence , the imperial family was gradually losing its power , to the extent that they had authority but no power .
in spite of this change , the imperial family was kokushu ( japanese feudal lord who governs more than one province ) of the 00 domains in japan .
** yoritomo , takauji , and ieyasu all became seiitaishogun , however , hideyoshi chose to be kanpaku ( chief adviser to the emperor ) .
he was even offered the positions of kanpaku , daijo-daijin ( grand minister ) , or seitaishogun from the imperial court ( the question of the three alternative positions , called sanshoku suinin mondai ) .
** the government controls the whole country .
** as explained above , unification of the whole country means to unify the whole of japan in an integrated fashion .
the governments of hideyoshi and ieyasu , both in name and reality , were in control of the whole country .
yoritomo mainly ruled togoku ( eastern country ) , he could also control the whole country by the system of gokenin ( shogunal retainers ) .
at the time of takauji , the northern and southern courts both claimed to be the legitimate governments .
the northern court , led by the ashikaga family , was always more powerful than the government of the southern court ruled by kuge ( court nobles ) and the northern court governed kyoto , which was the center of japan during that time .
nobunaga ' s government also ruled the kinai region ( the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of nara and kyoto ) and the imperial courts of this area .
in that sense , it is thought that the government had power over the whole country .
** be eager to take the reins of the government
** first of all , they must have the will to become tenka-bito .
however , the degree of eagerness is a different matter .
how much one is eager to establish a central administration ( the kuge , court nobles , government ) depended on how the state of affairs were progressing .
** also , it was only after the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) that the society began showing its attitude of giving a chance to anyone to rule the tenka as long as they had the will to do so .
few people truly had the will to do so and even fewer actually succeeded in accomplishing this goal .
** have a certain military force and economical power .
** the government of tenka-bito should be strong enough in military terms to eliminate obstacles and overwhelm rivals .
even after the establishment of the government , they needed military power to control those who would rebel against their government .
however , this military power was not always their own and did not have to be .
the military power would be evaluated by its amount and quality .
** economical power was also an important factor in having tenka under control .
in japan , the major economical power was agricultural productivity , particularly , rice production .
rice , as well as money , was a convenient commercial product that could be circulated .
however , the circulation of rice was not the only goal of the activities of the territorial lords and shogun .
taira no kiyomori emphasized trade between japan and the sung dynasty in china and yoshimitsu ashikaga was keen on trading between japan and the ming dynasty in china .
it is well known that nobunaga put great emphasis on trade and craft such as rakuichi-rakuza ( free markets and open guilds ) .
hideyoshi had gold mines and silver mines under direct control ; it is thought this factor helped him remain rich and powerful .
** have necessary social standing and status
** even though tenka-bito ran a military regime , it did not mean they wanted to govern by military power .
they had to think about how to look after and motivate their subordinates in order to gain their compliance to rule .
political force did not exist as an entity ; it only existed in the relationship with the subordinates .
** it can be thought that social standing or court rank was one of the important factors that cemented the relationship between the governor and his subordinates .
governors could actually justify their reasons for governing by having these attributes .
** yoritomo was a direct descendant of seiwa-genji ( the minamoto clan ) and had a social status as great-great-grandson of hachimantaro yoshiie .
takauji was the same .
however , during the sengoku period after the onin war ( 0000-0000 ) , gekokujo ( an inverted social order when the lowly reigned over the elite ) became more prevalent and the collapse of family status began to happen .
not only hideyoshi , but also nobunaga and ieyasu did not have high positions .
after the collapse of the importance of family status , there was a trend in the society to overlook the origins as long as they have the ability to rule .
** have certain abilities .
** it is often thought that people who influenced human history had extraordinary abilities , however , in reality , that was not always the case .
people who governed the tenka may have had abilities that excelled others , however , at the same time , there must also have been numbers of people who had the same level of abilities .
however , one cannot deny the fact that it is we who flattered and raised them to the positions of big politicians , heroes , and revolutionaries .
** be surrounded by good conditions and environment
** having seen the process of becoming a tenka-bito , it is clear that a combination of circumstances and chance , would raise someone to the position .
** in 0000 , ieyasu received the proclamation of seiitaishogun and started the edo bakufu .
the edo bakufu lasted for 00 successive reigns , some 000 years , until the time of yoshinobu tokugawa .
however , with the arrival of the black ships , reverence for the emperor became dominant and led to the fall of the tokugawa shogunate after 000 years of government .
samurai government ended as society saw the taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) , then the restoration of imperial rule , and finally the meiji restoration .
after that , japan took the path for the modernization .
** oomi ( a government post in ancient japan )
** ooomi was a post in the yamato kingdom in the kofun period .
ooomi assisted ookimi , the king , in administering the country by heading taifu who followed the kingdom .
the leading figure among prominent leaders with a kabane title omi took the position of oomi .
in " nihonshoki , " the name takeuchi no sukune appears as the first ooomi , but he is not considered a real person .
but the members from the powerful clans like the kazuraki clan , the heguri clan , the kose clan , and the soga clan , all of which claimed that they were descended from takeuchi no sukune , became ooomi .
** in 000 during the reign of emperor kogyoku , soga no emishi killed himself in the isshi incident , which was the end of the prosperity of the soga clan .
emperor kotoku , who was enthroned immediately after the incident , replaced ooomi with sadaijin and udaijin to prevent one post from grasping the authority .
** omuraji ( ancient japan )
** omuraji is one of the governmental posts of the yamato sovereignty ( the ancient japan sovereignty ) during the kofun period ( tumulus period ) .
leading daifu ( master ) , who followed the sovereignty , omuraji administered as the assistant of okimi ( emperor ) .
among the muraji , one of the kabane ( hereditary titles ) , the otomo clan and the mononobe clan , the most powerful clans who managed the military affairs and served as the tomonomiyatsuko ( the chief of various departments at the imperial court ) , became omuraji .
** mononobenotochine ' s name is recorded as the first omi in " nihonshoki " ( the chronicles of japan ) , however , as it was the time of emperor suinin , its existence is suspected .
** when mononobe no arakahi died at the time of emperor senka , mononobe no okoshi , who was the male cousin of his father , was appointed as omuraji .
however , after otomo no kanamura , who failed in the management of korean peninsula , was forced to resign due to the denouncement of mononobe no okoshi , the position of omuraji was only assumed by the mononobe clan .
in the late sixth century , which was the time of emperor bidatsu and emperor yomei , mononobe no moriya , a son of okoshi , was appointed as omuraji .
** naishi no suke ( a court lady of the first rank )
** naishi no suke until the end of edo period
** naishi no suke in the meiji period and later
** duty of naishi no suke
** abolition of naishi no suke
** naishi no suke was a government post in the ritsuryo system ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) and an undersecretary ( a court lady ) of naishi no tsukasa ( female palace attendants in kokyu [empress ' s residence . ] )
** the director was naishi no tsukasa , but later , naishi no tsukasa became the empress , so that no one was appointed to that position and naishi no suke practically served as the director .
** in the kanisoto sei ( the ranks of the bureaucracy system of the ritsuryo system ) , naishi no suke ranked at jushiijo ( junior fourth rank ) ( or jushiinoge [junior fourth rank , lower grade] ) , but often promoted to the second or the third ranks .
** it is also read as ' suke ' or ' tenji . '
many of them were called themselves by adding their family names or the government posts of their fathers before the post name , such as to no naishi no suke , or dainagon naishi no suke ( secretary of major councilor ) .
** naishi no suke was the highest rank of the high-quality court ladies in the palace at the end of edo period .
some naishi no suke served as the secretary in the daily life of the emperor ( vestal court ladies ) , others served as the concubines who receive the total favor of the emperor and bear princes and princesses .
( almost all of the real mothers of the emperors who were enthroned in the edo period were naishi no suke .
in the imperial families of the recent period , the biological child of seishitsu ( legal wife ) became the heir in the first time ever in the generations of empress teimei and empress kojun . )
therefore , only daughters of kuge ( a court noble ) having the certain family status could be naishi no suke , and the daughters of higher ranked kuge among urinke and meike became naishi no suke .
** the court ladies including naishi no suke were occupied by daughters of kuge until the end of the edo period and they had the immeasurable power in the court by serving close to the emperor , however , drastic reform was executed by the new meiji government .
next , all the court ladies under the rank of naishi no suke who were placed under the emperor were integrated and moved under the empress , and daughters of samurai families and the peerage could be adopted .
** further , the government posts of the empress and court ladies were arranged , and naishi no kami ( principal handmaid ) was again placed above naishi no suke , however , it practically remained vacancy .
naruko yanagihara , the mother of emperor taisho was the last naishi no suke who was the real mother of the emperor in the imperial palace .
thereafter , naishi no suke played a role only as the court lady for clerical work in the modern age , however , its recruitment standard depended on the caste system until the end of edo period .
the examples of such court ladies were toshiko kishida and utako shimada .
the salary of naishi no suke was 000 yen ( the first salary of a teacher of an elementary school at that time was 0 yen ) , and the salary of gon no naishi no suke was 000 yen in the meiji era .
** in ' document about acquaintanceship of kyujo nyokan , ' the duties of naishi no suke and gon no naishi no suke until the taisho era were specified .
according to the document , the duties of naishi no suke and gon no naishi no suke were :
** to stand by the emperor and the empress to control everything in front of them ;
to take charge of the costume above the waist of the emperor and the empress , tray services , and bathing .
** to supervise the court ladies ;
to hold kenji ( the sacred sword and the sacred jewel ) and hand them to the chokunin jiju ( chamberlain appointed by the royal command ) at the kenji togyo ( ceremony for imperial succession ) ;
to attend the pray in the shinden ( shrine sanctuary ) such as kashikodokoro ( a palace sanctuary ) and koreiden ( a palace enshrines the sprits of ancestor ) as the proxy for the empress when she cannot attend ;
to manage a grant and a gift ;
to mediate the visit from the imperial family to the emperor and the empress ;
to manage the stored money ;
and others .
** daikan ( local governor )
** daikan in the edo period
** daikansho ( daikan ' s administrative office )
** a daikan ( local governor ) meant a person , who performed the public administration and construction in a designated territory on behalf of his monarch ( state ) , and his rank .
daikan became one of the samurai government ' s posts in japan .
** daikan before the edo period .
** originally , the concept of daikan represented a deputy post which administered political affairs and ruling in koryo ( government ' s territory ) or shoryo ( private territory ) .
before the samurai government came into power , a typical sample of the post was mokudai acting as deputy of kokushi .
** daikan in the early edo period were mostly hereditary posts , and small sized gozoku ( local ruling families ) and jizamurai ( local samurai ) residing in the local lands were selected to be daikan and taken into the bakufu as retainers .
among the daikan , famous figures are tarozaemon egawa of nirayama daikan office , miyagawa no tomoyuki sukezaemon of matsuzaki daikan office , and shigenari suzuki of amakusa daikan office .
with the increase of bureaucratic daikan , although their term was not fixed , they were mostly replaced within a few years after the kanei era ( 0000 - 0000 ) .
the lands administered by daikan were generally said to be easier to live than in the other ones governed by daimyo ( lord whose domains have at least 00 , 000 koku of rice [one koku equals 0 . 0 bushels] ) .
it should be noted that the daikan had a different role from sunpu machi bugyo ( sunpu town magistrate ) , sado bugyo ( sado mine magistrate ) , etc .
** due to the above reasons , the bad image of daikan—oppressing peasants , receiving bribe from merchants , and ruling local women－has widely spread .
bosses and superiors who order irrational demand are sarcastically called odaikan sama ( mr . daikan ) today , which derives from the persistent images of the bad daikan in those dramas .
due to influence of these period dramas , people sometimes jocularly use the word , odaikan sama , when they beg somebody for something .
** however , actually , the political system removed a daikan who was even slightly ill reputed without delay , so a bad daikan pursuing his personal greed could not exist for a long time in that society .
as severe levy of nengu ( annual tribute ) led to peasants ' chosan ( to abandon one ' s field and flee away to other districts to evade cruel taxes ) , which adversely decreased the amount of collected nengu .
there were actually some daikan who were dismissed and punished due to their responsibility for people who died from starving at the time of famines .
basically , in fact , daikan were so busy that most of them could not even find time to think about the evil conducts as written above .
** the area under the daikan ' s control was several tens of thousands of koku , which was usually considered as one unit of his area .
the daikan set up a jinya ( or called daikansho ; regional office of administrative officials ) in their jurisdictional area to administrate .
under the daikan , there were about 00 tetsuke ( assistants of daikan but an immediate vassal of the shogunate ; busi class ) and a few tedai ( assistants of daikan ; servant for a samurai family ) , who assisted him .
when the daikan ' s appointed lands were in remote places , zaichi ( to reside in one ' s place ) was the principle .
** the status of daikan as a bushi was low in various han , many daikan were in kachi ( foot guard ) class with appanage of below 00 koku and also were inherited by local powerful families .
in the latter case , their kakaku ( family status ) were mostly kachi class in the han .
** furthermore , in outlands , local rich farmers were mostly appointed as daikan and no officials were sent .
the rewards in this case were status privileges such as myojitaito ( the right to bear a surname and to wear a sword ) and tax privileges such as tax exemption and permission to use utility mail system .
** daikansho was an administrative office , where a daikan was sent and performed administration , set up in the territory under the direct control of the edo bakufu such as shihaijo ( bakufu-owned land ) and tenryo in the edo period .
as the feudal system under the shogunate ( bakuhan taisei system ) had been completely established in the edo period , the size of daikansho was rather small considering the size of the area which the daikan administrated .
when local powerful persons were appointed as daikan , their residences were used as daikansho without setting up exclusive ones , and the local people such as their family members and servants served as the officials of the daikan .
** otsu-bugyo
** otsu-bugyo ( otsu magistrate ) is a post created in otsu domain of omi province ( present-day otsu city , shiga prefecture ) in the middle ages .
sometimes , the name otsu daikan was used to refer to the post and both names were used at the same time .
** otsu-bugyo appointment is believed to date back to 0000 , when it was created by the rokkaku clan ( either by ujitsuna or sadayori rokkaku ) and kiyomune komai was appointed to the post , but the details remain unknown .
since then , kiyomune has assumed the otsu name , with the bugyo post held by his descendants for generations .
after the downfall of the rokkaku clan , nobunaga oda dispatched a daikan ( local governor ) to otsu with the approval of yoshiaki ashikaga and brought the region under his rule .
** in 0000 , ieyasu tokugawa appointed kanbei sueyoshi as otsu-bugyo and separated the bugyo and daikan posts the following year with the appointment of nagayasu okubo as otsu-daikan .
in 0000 , otsu-bugyo was positioned as ongoku-bugyo ( magistrate placed in important areas for direct government control ) and otsu-daikan was placed under its command , but they were both abolished in 0000 when they were absorbed into kyoto machi bugyo ( kyoto city magistrates ) .
** junkenshi
** establishment
** shokoku-junkenshi
** junkenshi inspection tours under shogunate reigns
** goryo-junkenshi
** inspections for junkenshi
** the junkenshi is an envoy of the edo shogunate dispatched for surveillance of the daimyos ( feudal lords ) and hatamotos ( shogunal retainers ) , and for research on the situation .
the junkenshi can be classified broadly into goryo-junkenshi sent to inspect the kogi-goryo ( tenryo [shogunal properties] ) and hatamoto fiefdoms and shokoku-junkenshi responsible for surveillance of the daimyos of domains .
** each envoy was accompanied by one hatamoto each from tsukaiban ( responsible for order and patrol ) , koshogumi ( page corps ) or shoinban ( castle guard ) offices , serving as vice-envoys .
in addition to revision of the map , these envoys are believed to have been on the mission of confirming the travel routes to be taken by the daimyos and their retinues in the sankinkotai that had already been in planning at that time .
** in order to confirm the state of progress in the inquisition , the shokoku-junkenshi system was introduced on february 00 , 0000 ( based on the old calendar ) .
** at the same time , jurisdiction was also defined by dividing the country into 0 districts .
in accordance with the system established in the kanbun and tenna eras , dispatch of envoys in behalf of the new shogun became established practice , excluding the case of ietsugu tokugawa , who died in childhood .
** for this reason , the feudal lords attempted to ingratiate themselves to the junkenshi , organizing receptions that could be regarded extreme and imposing great burden on villages along the route that the envoys passed .
furthermore , they created q&a manuals known as ' junken-ogi . '
in addition , junkenshi inspection had its limitations because domains that had not violated shogunate policy were allowed a measure of autonomy .
** since the kanbun inspection , there had been 0 such tours until 0000 for ieyoshi tokugawa .
on september 00 , 0000 ( based on the old calendar ) , the second year of the reign of yoshinobu tokugawa , junkenshi itself was terminated on grounds of confusion within the country and fiscal decline in feudal domains .
it was only one month later that the taisei hokan ( return of power to the emperor ) took place .
** the following shows the dates when shokoku-junkenshi dispatch order were issued after accession of a new shogun and the actual years when the tours were dispatched .
** tsunayoshi tokugawa
order issued on march 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent in the same year .
ienobu tokugawa
order issued on march 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent in the same year .
yoshimune tokugawa
order issued on september 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent during the same year and the following year .
ieshige tokugawa
order issued on november 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent in the following year .
ieharu tokugawa
order issued on august 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent during the same year and the following year .
ienari tokugawa
order issued on may 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent during 0000 and 0000 .
ieyoshi tokugawa
order issued on august 00 , 0000 , and envoys sent in the following year .
** due to kogi-goryo being scattered widely in many parts , the country was divided into 00 territories .
** starting in 0000 , the goryo-junkenshi were dispatched simultaneously with shokoku-junkenshi at the change of shogun .
** reports for surveillance of remote domains submitted by the oniwaban ( intelligence officers ) show findings of the behavior of the junkenshi during their inspections at feudal domains .
the oniwaban appear to have been assigned surveys of the junkenshi as part of their intelligence activities .
** tsukaiban
** tsukaiban is a post in the edo shogunate .
in older times , it was also called tsukai-yaku .
** the post originates from the function of the military officer in the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , who served as messenger and scout in the battlefield and messenger to the enemy army .
the post stayed in the edo shogunate .
** for this reason , the number was halved to 00 in 0000 , and salary was revised in the following year , with executive allowance kept at 000 ryo ( gold pieces ) for those earning more than 0000 koku and half the amount for lower-rank earners .
** kahan
** summary
** kahan , also called kahan no retsu ( joint surety ) means originally a chief retainer who had authority to sign or put seal at carrying out an order of a lord .
the word had often been seen since the end of the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) .
** the word kahan was used in various meanings by the edo shogunate , territorial lords , hatamoto and others .
** in the edo shogunate , roju ( senior councillor of the tokugawa shogunate ) was kahan no retsu , but in the beginning those who were qualified to attend hyojosho ( conference chamber ) such as kanjo bugyo ( commissioner of finance ) were also considered as kahan .
** kahan was used as follows in domains .
** 0 . kahan ( or kabanshu ) was used for the same meaning as karo ( chief retainer ) , or as the name of the social standing of a family and kakaku ( family status ) .
** 0 . kahan was sometimes used as an official title given to qualified people to attend a conference of chief retainers such as hyojosho ( conference chamber ) .
in such a case , position of karo was naturally kahan , so people in lower positions ( bugyo [magistrate] , yonin [officer handling domestic economy] ) were called kahan at the assignment .
** 0 . there was uncommon example in a domain which had more positions of karo than the size of domain that karo qualified as kahan and karo unqualified as kahan were separated .
** 0 . sometimes , those who were from karo family were regarded as karo kahan when they became professional karo , and those who were from non karo family were regarded as karo without qualification of kahan when they became karo .
** as for hatamoto of bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , the highest rank of vassal was often not karo but yonin and in this case , the yonin was kahan .
** fudai genin ( low-ranked people in the hereditary succession )
** fudai genin were called keho , monya , niwako and uchibyakusho depending on region .
** in the sengoku period , humans were trafficked due to habit of ranbodori ( pillage by soldiers after battles ) but the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) prohibited human trafficking .
** as regulation of human trafficking was reinforced , shichiken hokonin ( a servant put in pledge ) appeared as a way to circumvent the regulation .
** bakufu and domains officially prohibited human trafficking but in fact overlooked the existence of fudai genin since they wanted to give priority to stabilization of land tax collection caused by stability of farm management .
** an old custom , fudai genin ( in other words , keho ) ended in the meiji period since the release of social status and the prohibition of naming were issued in an ordinance in 0000 .
** shi ( government post )
** officials
** shi was a collective name of daishi and shoshi established in jingikan and daijokan ( benkankyoku ) under the japanese ritsuryo legal code system .
shi corresponds to sakan , the fourth rank of shitokan .
the prescribed number for jingikan was one for each of daishi and shoshi ( two in total ) , and that for daijokan was two for each of daishi and shoshi for each of sabenkankyoku and ubenkankyoku ( eight in total . )
** the officials who were in charge of writing were traditionally called ' fuhito ' , and the kabane of shi was sometimes conferred on the chinese and korean clans settled in japan who held the post of shi .
** in the ritsuryo legal code system , the duties of shi were recording and creating official documents under the command of a senior official , examining the official documents , reading proofs and asking for instructions from the senior official .
** later , when daishi in benkankyoku were raised to fifth rank ( taifu ) , they were especially called taifushi ( or shitaifu . )
** sadaishi ( senior sixth rank , upper grade ) : 0
udaishi ( senior sixth rank , upper grade ) : 0
sashoshi ( junior sixth rank , senior seventh rank ) : 0
ushoshi ( junior sixth rank , senior seventh rank ) : 0
sashisho : 00
ushisho : 00
sakajo : 0
ukajo : 0
meshitsukai : 0
sashibe : 00
ushibe : 00
** daisanji ( second to a governor )
** daisanji was a government post next to a chief of chihokan ( local officials ) placed during the time of fu-han-ken sanchisei ( fu-han-ken tripartite governance system ) in the early meiji period .
it is equivalent to current vice-prefectural governor and karo ( chief retainer ) in the feudal system characteristic of the shogunate .
** sei and gon daisanji in domains must concurrently have been members of kogisho ( the lower house ) but after the kogisho abolished , either of them became a councilor of shugiin ( whose name was changed from kogisho ) .
** in 0000 , councilors were placed in prefectures and the government post of daisanji was abolished due to the establishment of governmental regulation of prefectures accompanying haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) .
